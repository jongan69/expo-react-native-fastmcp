React Native

Get a head start with a framework
=================================

### React Native brings the React programming paradigm to platforms like Android and iOS. It doesn’t prescribe how to do routing, or how to access each of the numerous platform APIs. To build a new app with React Native, we recommend a framework like [Expo](https://expo.dev).

#### File-based routing

Create stack, modal, drawer, and tab screens with minimal boilerplate using your filesystem.

#### Use any library, SDK, or native code

Generate native changes or write your own native code. Use over 50 modules to create your app.

#### Developer tools

Get started quickly with Expo Go, then continue with expo-dev-client: a module that adds Expo’s tools to apps that require native changes.
