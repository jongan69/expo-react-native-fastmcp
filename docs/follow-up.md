---

Now that the example app is done, let's learn more about the technologies we used to build it.

Build your project into an app
------------------------------

To start creating a new app on your machine you can use `npx create-expo-app@latest` and [set up your development environment](/get-started/set-up-your-environment) sequentially.

### Recommended resources

Once you've created your new project, you can learn more about different tools and concepts that will help you on your app development journey:

* [Development tools](/develop/tools): A reference of Expo tools that will help you during various aspects of your app-building journey.
* [Development builds](/develop/development-builds/introduction): Using a development build allows you to gain full control over your app's build process, and to test your app on a device or simulator.
* [Development overview](/workflow/overview): This is a high-level overview that provides details on key concepts for developing an app with Expo and the flow of core development loop.
* [Expo Router](/router/introduction): We went through basics of Expo Router and implemented a tab navigator. See its documentation to learn more about the library.
* [App icon](/develop/user-interface/splash-screen-and-app-icon#app-icon) and [splash screen](/develop/user-interface/splash-screen-and-app-icon#splash-screen): You can learn more about customizing your app icon and splash screen guides. Also, look through the [app config reference](/workflow/configuration) for properties you can configure in the app.json file.
* [App distribution](/deploy/build-project) and [submission](/deploy/submit-to-app-stores) to app stores: Read these resources to learn more about how to release and submit your app to app stores once it's ready to ship.
* [Debugging](/debugging/runtime-issues): Sometimes things go wrong, and when they do, you can use debugging tools to find and fix errors.

Learning
--------

### React

We used React components and APIs. Having a solid understanding of React is essential to using Expo to build your app. We recommend reading the React documentation's [Quick Start section](https://react.dev/learn) and the [Hooks section](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks).

### React Native

While developing the tutorial app, we used React Native extensively. You can start from the [React Native basics guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) to learn more. Also, check out the following docs:

* [View API reference](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view)
* [Text API reference](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text)
* [Platform specific code](https://reactnative.dev/docs/platform-specific-code)
* [Presenting data in a list](https://reactnative.dev/docs/using-a-listview)

We used Flexbox to layout our components. Check out the following recommendations to learn more about it:

* [Height and Width](https://reactnative.dev/docs/height-and-width)
* [Layout with Flexbox](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flexbox)

### Gestures and animations

To learn more about implementing different types of gestures and animations, we recommend the following documentation:

* [React Native Gesture Handler](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/)
* [React Native Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/getting-started)
