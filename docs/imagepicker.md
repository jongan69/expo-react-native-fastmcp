Expo ImagePicker iconExpo ImagePicker
=====================================

[GitHub](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/sdk-52/packages/expo-image-picker)[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expo-image-picker)

A library that provides access to the system's UI for selecting images and videos from the phone's library or taking a photo with the camera.

[GitHub](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/sdk-52/packages/expo-image-picker)[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expo-image-picker)

Android

iOS

Web

Bundled version:

~16.0.6

---

`expo-image-picker` provides access to the system's UI for selecting images and videos from the phone's library or taking a photo with the camera.

Installation
------------

Terminal

Copy

`-Â``npx expo install expo-image-picker`

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

#### Known issuesâ iOS

On iOS, when an image (usually of a [higher resolution](http://www.openradar.me/49866214)) is picked from the camera roll, the result of the cropped image gives the wrong value for the cropped rectangle in some cases. Unfortunately, this issue is with the underlying `UIImagePickerController` due to a bug in the closed-source tools built into iOS.

Configuration in app config
---------------------------

You can configure `expo-image-picker` using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([EAS Build](/build/introduction) or `npx expo run:[android|ios]`). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect.

### Example app.json with config plugin

app.json

Copy

```
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-image-picker",
        {
          "photosPermission": "The app accesses your photos to let you share them with your friends."
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}

```

### Configurable properties

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `photosPermission` | `"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your photos"` | Only for:â iOS  A string to set the `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` permission message. |
| `cameraPermission` | `"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your camera"` | Only for:â iOS  A string to set the `NSCameraUsageDescription` permission message. |
| `microphonePermission` | `"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your microphone"` | Only for:â iOS  A string to set the `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` permission message. |

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) or you're using a native ios project manually, then you need to add `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`, `NSCameraUsageDescription`, and `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` keys to your ios/[app]/Info.plist:

Info.plist

Copy

```
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>Give $(PRODUCT_NAME) permission to save photos</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Give $(PRODUCT_NAME) permission to access your camera</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Give $(PRODUCT_NAME) permission to use your microphone</string>

```

Usage
-----

Image Picker

Copy

Open in Snack

```
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Button, Image, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import * as ImagePicker from 'expo-image-picker';

export default function ImagePickerExample() {
  const [image, setImage] = useState<string | null>(null);

  const pickImage = async () => {
    // No permissions request is necessary for launching the image library
    let result = await ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync({
      mediaTypes: ['images', 'videos'],
      allowsEditing: true,
      aspect: [4, 3],
      quality: 1,
    });

    console.log(result);

    if (!result.canceled) {
      setImage(result.assets[0].uri);
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Button title="Pick an image from camera roll" onPress={pickImage} />
      {image && <Image source={{ uri: image }} style={styles.image} />}
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  image: {
    width: 200,
    height: 200,
  },
});

```

When you run this example and pick an image, you will see the image that you picked show up in your app, and a similar log will be shown in the console:

```
{
  "assets": [
    {
      "assetId": "C166F9F5-B5FE-4501-9531",
      "base64": null,
      "duration": null,
      "exif": null,
      "fileName": "IMG.HEIC",
      "fileSize": 6018901,
      "height": 3025,
      "type": "image",
      "uri": "file:///data/user/0/host.exp.exponent/cache/cropped1814158652.jpg"
      "width": 3024
    }
  ],
  "canceled": false
}

```

Hooks
-----

### `useCameraPermissions(options)`

Android

iOS

Web

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| options(optional) | `PermissionHookOptions<object>` |

  

Check or request permissions to access the camera.
This uses both `requestCameraPermissionsAsync` and `getCameraPermissionsAsync` to interact with the permissions.

Returns:

`[null | PermissionResponse, RequestPermissionMethod<PermissionResponse>, GetPermissionMethod<PermissionResponse>]`

Example

```
const [status, requestPermission] = ImagePicker.useCameraPermissions();

```

### `useMediaLibraryPermissions(options)`

Android

iOS

Web

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| options(optional) | `PermissionHookOptions<{  writeOnly: boolean }>` |

  

Check or request permissions to access the media library.
This uses both `requestMediaLibraryPermissionsAsync` and `getMediaLibraryPermissionsAsync` to interact with the permissions.

Returns:

`[null | MediaLibraryPermissionResponse, RequestPermissionMethod<MediaLibraryPermissionResponse>, GetPermissionMethod<MediaLibraryPermissionResponse>]`

Example

```
const [status, requestPermission] = ImagePicker.useMediaLibraryPermissions();

```

Methods
-------

### `ImagePicker.getCameraPermissionsAsync()`

Android

iOS

Web

Checks user's permissions for accessing camera.

Returns:

`Promise<CameraPermissionResponse>`

A promise that fulfills with an object of type [CameraPermissionResponse](#camerapermissionresponse).

### `ImagePicker.getMediaLibraryPermissionsAsync(writeOnly)`

Android

iOS

Web

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| writeOnly(optional) | `boolean` | Whether to request write or read and write permissions. Defaults to `false`  Default:`false` |

  

Checks user's permissions for accessing photos.

Returns:

`Promise<MediaLibraryPermissionResponse>`

A promise that fulfills with an object of type [MediaLibraryPermissionResponse](#medialibrarypermissionresponse).

### `ImagePicker.getPendingResultAsync()`

Android

iOS

Web

Android system sometimes kills the `MainActivity` after the `ImagePicker` finishes. When this
happens, we lost the data selected from the `ImagePicker`. However, you can retrieve the lost
data by calling `getPendingResultAsync`. You can test this functionality by turning on
`Don't keep activities` in the developer options.

Returns:

`Promise<(ImagePickerResult | ImagePickerErrorResult)[]>`

* On Android: a promise that resolves to an array of objects of exactly same type as in
  `ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync` or `ImagePicker.launchCameraAsync` if the `ImagePicker`
  finished successfully. Otherwise, to the array of [`ImagePickerErrorResult`](#imagepickerimagepickererrorresult).
* On other platforms: an empty array.

### `ImagePicker.launchCameraAsync(options)`

Android

iOS

Web

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| options(optional) | `ImagePickerOptions` | An `ImagePickerOptions` object.  Default:`{}` |

  

Display the system UI for taking a photo with the camera. Requires `Permissions.CAMERA`.
On Android and iOS 10 `Permissions.CAMERA_ROLL` is also required. On mobile web, this must be
called immediately in a user interaction like a button press, otherwise the browser will block
the request without a warning.

> Note: Make sure that you handle `MainActivity` destruction on Android. See [ImagePicker.getPendingResultAsync](#imagepickergetpendingresultasync).
> Notes for Web: The system UI can only be shown after user activation (e.g. a `Button` press).
> Therefore, calling `launchCameraAsync` in `componentDidMount`, for example, will not work as
> intended. The `cancelled` event will not be returned in the browser due to platform restrictions
> and inconsistencies across browsers.

Returns:

`Promise<ImagePickerResult>`

A promise that resolves to an object with `canceled` and `assets` fields.
When the user canceled the action the `assets` is always `null`, otherwise it's an array of
the selected media assets which have a form of [`ImagePickerAsset`](#imagepickerasset).

### `ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync(options)`

Android

iOS

Web

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| options(optional) | `ImagePickerOptions` | An object extended by [`ImagePickerOptions`](#imagepickeroptions).  Default:`{}` |

  

Display the system UI for choosing an image or a video from the phone's library.
Requires `Permissions.MEDIA_LIBRARY` on iOS 10 only. On mobile web, this must be called
immediately in a user interaction like a button press, otherwise the browser will block the
request without a warning.

Animated GIFs support: On Android, if the selected image is an animated GIF, the result image will be an
animated GIF too if and only if `quality` is explicitly set to `1.0` and `allowsEditing` is set to `false`.
Otherwise compression and/or cropper will pick the first frame of the GIF and return it as the
result (on Android the result will be a PNG). On iOS, both quality and cropping are supported.

> Notes for Web: The system UI can only be shown after user activation (e.g. a `Button` press).
> Therefore, calling `launchImageLibraryAsync` in `componentDidMount`, for example, will not
> work as intended. The `cancelled` event will not be returned in the browser due to platform
> restrictions and inconsistencies across browsers.

Returns:

`Promise<ImagePickerResult>`

A promise that resolves to an object with `canceled` and `assets` fields.
When the user canceled the action the `assets` is always `null`, otherwise it's an array of
the selected media assets which have a form of [`ImagePickerAsset`](#imagepickerasset).

### `ImagePicker.requestCameraPermissionsAsync()`

Android

iOS

Web

Asks the user to grant permissions for accessing camera. This does nothing on web because the
browser camera is not used.

Returns:

`Promise<CameraPermissionResponse>`

A promise that fulfills with an object of type [CameraPermissionResponse](#camerarollpermissionresponse).

### `ImagePicker.requestMediaLibraryPermissionsAsync(writeOnly)`

Android

iOS

Web

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| writeOnly(optional) | `boolean` | Whether to request write or read and write permissions. Defaults to `false`  Default:`false` |

  

Asks the user to grant permissions for accessing user's photo. This method does nothing on web.

Returns:

`Promise<MediaLibraryPermissionResponse>`

A promise that fulfills with an object of type [MediaLibraryPermissionResponse](#medialibrarypermissionresponse).

Android

iOS

Web

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| allowsEditing(optional) | `boolean` | Only for:â Android  iOS  Whether to show a UI to edit the image after it is picked. On Android the user can crop and rotate the image and on iOS simply crop it.  * Cropping multiple images is not supported - this option is mutually exclusive with `allowsMultipleSelection`. * On iOS, this option is ignored if `allowsMultipleSelection` is enabled. * On iOS cropping a `.bmp` image will convert it to `.png`.  Default:`false` |
| allowsMultipleSelection(optional) | `boolean` | Only for:â Android  iOS 14+  Web  Whether or not to allow selecting multiple media files at once.  Cropping multiple images is not supported - this option is mutually exclusive with `allowsEditing`. If this option is enabled, then `allowsEditing` is ignored.  Default:`false` |
| aspect(optional) | `[number, number]` | An array with two entries `[x, y]` specifying the aspect ratio to maintain if the user is allowed to edit the image (by passing `allowsEditing: true`). This is only applicable on Android, since on iOS the crop rectangle is always a square. |
| base64(optional) | `boolean` | Whether to also include the image data in Base64 format. |
| cameraType(optional) | `CameraType` | Only for:â Android  iOS  Selects the camera-facing type.

Default:`CameraType.back` |
| exif(optional) | `boolean` | Only for:â Android  iOS  Whether to also include the EXIF data for the image. On iOS the EXIF data does not include GPS tags in the camera case. |
| legacy(optional) | `boolean` | Only for:â Android  Uses the legacy image picker on Android. This will allow media to be selected from outside the users photo library.  Default:`false` |
| mediaTypes(optional) | `MediaType | MediaType[] | MediaTypeOptions` | Choose what type of media to pick.  Default:`'images'` |
| orderedSelection(optional) | `boolean` | Only for:â iOS 15+  Whether to display number badges when assets are selected. The badges are numbered in selection order. Assets are then returned in the exact same order they were selected.  Assets should be returned in the selection order regardless of this option, but there is no guarantee that it is always true when this option is disabled.  Default:`false` |
| preferredAssetRepresentationMode(optional) | `UIImagePickerPreferredAssetRepresentationMode` | Only for:â iOS 14+  Choose [preferred asset representation mode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photokit/phpickerconfigurationassetrepresentationmode) to use when loading assets.  Default:`ImagePicker.UIImagePickerPreferredAssetRepresentationMode.Automatic` |
| presentationStyle(optional) | `UIImagePickerPresentationStyle` | Only for:â iOS  Choose [presentation style](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiviewcontroller/1621355-modalpresentationstyle?language=objc) to customize view during taking photo/video.  Default:`ImagePicker.UIImagePickerPresentationStyle.Automatic` |
| quality(optional) | `number` | Only for:â Android  iOS  Specify the quality of compression, from `0` to `1`. `0` means compress for small size, `1` means compress for maximum quality.  Note: If the selected image has been compressed before, the size of the output file may be bigger than the size of the original image.  Note: On iOS, if a `.bmp` or `.png` image is selected from the library, this option is ignored.  Default:`1.0` |
| selectionLimit(optional) | `number` | Only for:â Android  iOS 14+  The maximum number of items that user can select. Applicable when `allowsMultipleSelection` is enabled. Setting the value to `0` sets the selection limit to the maximum that the system supports.  Default:`0` |
