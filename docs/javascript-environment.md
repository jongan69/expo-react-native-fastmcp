JavaScript Environment
======================

JavaScript Runtime[â€‹](#javascript-runtime "Direct link to JavaScript Runtime")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When using React Native, you're going to be running your JavaScript code in up to three environments:

* In most cases, React Native will use [Hermes](/docs/hermes), an open-source JavaScript engine optimized for React Native.
* If Hermes is disabled, React Native will use [JavaScriptCore](https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/JavaScriptCore), the JavaScript engine that powers Safari. Note that on iOS, JavaScriptCore does not use JIT due to the absence of writable executable memory in iOS apps.
* When using Chrome debugging, all JavaScript code runs within Chrome itself, communicating with native code via WebSockets. Chrome uses [V8](https://v8.dev/) as its JavaScript engine.

While these environments are very similar, you may end up hitting some inconsistencies. It is best to avoid relying on specifics of any runtime.

JavaScript Syntax Transformers[â€‹](#javascript-syntax-transformers "Direct link to JavaScript Syntax Transformers")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Syntax transformers make writing code more enjoyable by allowing you to use new JavaScript syntax without having to wait for support on all interpreters.

React Native ships with the [Babel JavaScript compiler](https://babeljs.io). Check [Babel documentation](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/#transform-plugins) on its supported transformations for more details.

A full list of React Native's enabled transformations can be found in [@react-native/babel-preset](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/tree/main/packages/react-native-babel-preset).
