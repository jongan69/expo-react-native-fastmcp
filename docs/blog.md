Today we are excited to release React Native 0.79!

This release ships with performance improvements on various fronts, as well as several bugfixes. First, Metro is now faster to start thanks to deferred hashing, and has stable support for package exports. Startup time in Android will also be improved thanks to changes in the JS bundle compressions and much more.

Every year, the core contributors in the React Native Community get together with the React Native team to collaboratively shape the direction of this project.

Last year was no different—with small exception. We usually meet a day before [React Universe Conf](https://www.reactuniverseconf.com) (formerly React Native EU) at [Callstack](https://www.callstack.com/open-source) HQ in Wrocław. In 2024, learning from past experiences, we hosted the Summit for two consecutive days, so that we can have more unstructured time together.

Today we are excited to release React Native 0.77!

This release ships several features: new styling capabilities such as support for `display: contents`, `boxSizing`, `mixBlendMode`, and `outline`-related properties to provide a more powerful layout options; Android 16KB page support to be compatible with the newer Android devices. We are also modernizing the community template by migrating it to Swift, while continuing to support and maintain compatibility with Objective-C for developers who prefer it.

React Native 0.76 with the New Architecture by default is now available on npm!

In the [0.76 release blog post](/blog/2024/10/23/release-0.76-new-architecture), we shared a list of significant changes included in this version. In this post, we provide an overview of the New Architecture and how it shapes the future of React Native.

The New Architecture adds full support for modern React features, including [Suspense](https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18#new-suspense-features), [Transitions](https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18#new-feature-transitions), [automatic batching](https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18#new-feature-automatic-batching), and [`useLayoutEffect`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useLayoutEffect). The New Architecture also includes new [Native Module](/docs/next/turbo-native-modules-introduction) and [Native Component](/docs/next/fabric-native-components-introduction) systems that let you write type-safe code with direct access to native interfaces without a bridge.

This release is the result of a ground-up rewrite of React Native we’ve been working on since 2018, and we’ve taken extra care to make the New Architecture a gradual migration for most apps. In 2021, we created [the New Architecture Working Group](https://github.com/reactwg/react-native-new-architecture/) to collaborate with the community on ensuring a smooth upgrade experience for the entire React ecosystem.

Most apps will be able to adopt React Native 0.76 with the same level of effort as any other release. The most popular React Native libraries already support the New Architecture. The New Architecture also includes an automatic interoperability layer to enable backward compatibility with libraries targeting the old architecture.

At [React Conf](https://www.youtube.com/live/0ckOUBiuxVY?si=pU4qP4eB5iWfY0IG&t=2320), we updated our guidance on the best tool to get started building React Native apps: a **React Native framework** - a toolbox with all the necessary APIs to let you build production-ready apps.

Using React Native frameworks, such as Expo, is now the **recommended** approach to create new apps.

In this blogpost we want to walk you through what they are in detail and what they mean for you as a React Native developer starting a new project.
