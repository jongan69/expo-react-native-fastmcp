---

[BugSnag](https://www.bugsnag.com) is a stability monitoring solution that provides rich, end-to-end error reporting and analytics to reproduce and fix errors with speed and precision. BugSnag supports the full stack with open-source libraries for more than [50 platforms](https://www.bugsnag.com/platforms), including [React Native](https://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/react-native/react-native/).

With BugSnag, developers and engineering organizations can:

* Stabilize: Innovate faster by knowing when to build new features versus fix bugs. Use the release health dashboard, stability scores and targets, and built-in alerts via email, Slack, PagerDuty, and more.
* Prioritize: Improve customer experience by identifying and prioritizing bugs that have the greatest impact on app stability. Analyze issues grouped by root cause and sorted by business impact, customer segmentation, A/B testing and experiment results.
* Fix: Increase productivity by spending less time on reproducing and fixing bugs. Utilize powerful diagnostic data, full stacktraces and automatic breadcrumbs.
