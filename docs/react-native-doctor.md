React Native Community

After over 20 pull requests from 6 contributors in the React Native Community, we're excited to launch `react-native doctor`, a new command to help you out with getting started, troubleshooting and automatically fixing errors with your development environment. The `doctor` command is heavily inspired by [Expo](https://expo.io/) and [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)'s own doctor command with a pinch of UI inspired by [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

Here it is in action:

[](/img/homepage/DoctorCommand.mp4)

How it works[​](#how-it-works "Direct link to How it works")
------------------------------------------------------------

The `doctor` command currently supports most of the software and libraries that React Native relies on, such as CocoaPods, Xcode and Android SDK. With `doctor` we'll find issues with your development environment and give you the option to automatically fix them. If `doctor` is not able to fix an issue, it will display a message and a helpful link explaining how to fix it manually as the following:

![Doctor command with a link to help on Android SDK's installation](/img/DoctorManualInstallationMessage.png "Doctor command with a link to help on Android SDK's installation")

Try it now[​](#try-it-now "Direct link to Try it now")
------------------------------------------------------

The `doctor` command is available as a part of React Native 0.62. However, you can try it without upgrading yet:

```
npx @react-native-community/cli doctor  

```

What checks are currently supported[​](#what-checks-are-currently-supported "Direct link to What checks are currently supported")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`doctor` currently supports the following checks:

* Node.js (>= 8.3)
* yarn (>= 1.10)
* npm (>= 4)
* Watchman (>= 4), used for watching changes in the filesystem when in development mode.

Specific to the Android environment:

* Android SDK (>= 26), the software runtime for Android.
* Android NDK (>= 19), the native development toolkit for Android.
* `ANDROID_HOME`, environment variable required by the Android SDK setup.

And to the iOS environment:

* Xcode (>= 10), IDE for developing, building and shipping iOS applications.
* CocoaPods, library dependency management tool for iOS applications.
* ios-deploy (optional), library used internally by the CLI to install applications on a physical iOS device.

Thanks[​](#thanks "Direct link to Thanks")
------------------------------------------

Huge thanks for the React Native Community for working on this, in particular [@thymikee](https://github.com/thymikee), [@thib92](https://github.com/thib92), [@jmeistrich](https://github.com/jmeistrich), [@tido64](https://github.com/tido64) and [@rickhanlonii](https://github.com/rickhanlonii).
