```
import KeepAwake from 'expo-keep-awake';

```

Constants
---------

### `KeepAwake.ExpoKeepAwakeTag`

Type: `'ExpoKeepAwakeDefaultTag'`

Default tag, used when no tag has been specified in keep awake method calls.

Hooks
-----

### `useKeepAwake(tag, options)`

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| tag(optional) | `string` | Tag to lock screen sleep prevention. If not provided, an ID unique to the owner component is used. |
| options(optional) | `KeepAwakeOptions` | Additional options for the keep awake hook. |

  

A React hook to keep the screen awake for as long as the owner component is mounted.
The optionally provided `tag` argument is used when activating and deactivating the keep-awake
feature. If unspecified, an ID unique to the owner component is used. See the documentation for
`activateKeepAwakeAsync` below to learn more about the `tag` argument.

Returns:

`void`

Methods
-------

> Deprecated use `activateKeepAwakeAsync` instead.

### `KeepAwake.activateKeepAwake(tag)`

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| tag(optional) | `string` | Tag to lock screen sleep prevention. If not provided, the default tag is used.  Default:`ExpoKeepAwakeTag` |

  

Prevents the screen from sleeping until `deactivateKeepAwake` is called with the same `tag` value.

If the `tag` argument is specified, the screen will not sleep until you call `deactivateKeepAwake`
with the same `tag` argument. When using multiple `tags` for activation you'll have to deactivate
each one in order to re-enable screen sleep. If tag is unspecified, the default `tag` is used.

Web support [is limited](https://caniuse.com/wake-lock).

Returns:

`Promise<void>`

### `KeepAwake.activateKeepAwakeAsync(tag)`
