Communities
===========

The React Native ecosystem is far and wide, and people can be part of it in many forms; here you will find but a partial list of different ways one developer can be part of it. If you know of other, or want to help expand this page, [submit a PR](https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)!

### Local communities[​](#local-communities "Direct link to Local communities")

There are a lot of React Native gatherings that happen around the world. Often there is React Native content in React meetups as well, use tools like [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/topics/react-native/) and [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/d/online/react-native/?page=1) to find out recent events in your area - or start one!
