Expo Brightness iconExpo Brightness
===================================

[GitHub](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/sdk-53/packages/expo-brightness)[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expo-brightness)

A library that provides access to an API for getting and setting the screen brightness.

[GitHub](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/sdk-53/packages/expo-brightness)[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expo-brightness)

Android

iOS

Bundled version:

~13.1.4

---

An API to get and set screen brightness.

On Android, there is a global system-wide brightness setting, and each app has its own brightness setting that can optionally override the global setting. It is possible to set either of these values with this API. On iOS, the system brightness setting cannot be changed programmatically; instead, any changes to the screen brightness will persist until the device is locked or powered off.

Installation
------------

Terminal

Copy

`-Â``npx expo install expo-brightness`

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

Configuration
-------------

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) or you're using a native android project manually, then you need to add the `android.permission.WRITE_SETTINGS` permission to the AndroidManifest.xml file:

android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml

Copy

```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_SETTINGS" />

```

Usage
-----

Basic Brightness Usage

Copy

Open in Snack

```
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, View, Text } from 'react-native';
import * as Brightness from 'expo-brightness';

export default function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      const { status } = await Brightness.requestPermissionsAsync();
      if (status === 'granted') {
        Brightness.setSystemBrightnessAsync(1);
      }
    })();
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Brightness Module Example</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
});

```

API
---

```
import * as Brightness from 'expo-brightness';

```

Hooks
-----

### `usePermissions(options)`

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| options(optional) | `PermissionHookOptions<object>` |

  

Check or request permissions to modify the system brightness.
This uses both `requestPermissionAsync` and `getPermissionsAsync` to interact with the permissions.

Returns:

`[null | PermissionResponse, RequestPermissionMethod<PermissionResponse>, GetPermissionMethod<PermissionResponse>]`

Example

```
const [permissionResponse, requestPermission] = Brightness.usePermissions();

```

Methods
-------

### `Brightness.getBrightnessAsync()`

Gets the current brightness level of the device's main screen.

Returns:

`Promise<number>`

A `Promise` that fulfils with a number between `0` and `1`, inclusive, representing the
current screen brightness.

### `Brightness.getPermissionsAsync()`

Checks user's permissions for accessing system brightness.

Returns:

`Promise<PermissionResponse>`

A promise that fulfils with an object of type [PermissionResponse](#permissionresponse).

### `Brightness.getSystemBrightnessAsync()`

Only for:â

Android

Gets the global system screen brightness.

Returns:

`Promise<number>`

A `Promise` that is resolved with a number between `0` and `1`, inclusive, representing
the current system screen brightness.

### `Brightness.getSystemBrightnessModeAsync()`

Only for:â

Android

Gets the system brightness mode (e.g. whether or not the OS will automatically
adjust the screen brightness depending on ambient light).

Returns:

`Promise<BrightnessMode>`

A `Promise` that fulfils with a [`BrightnessMode`](#brightnessmode). Requires
`SYSTEM_BRIGHTNESS` permissions.

### `Brightness.isAvailableAsync()`

Returns whether the Brightness API is enabled on the current device. This does not check the app
permissions.

Returns:

`Promise<boolean>`

Async `boolean`, indicating whether the Brightness API is available on the current device.
Currently this resolves `true` on iOS and Android only.

### `Brightness.isUsingSystemBrightnessAsync()`

Only for:â

Android

Returns a boolean specifying whether or not the current activity is using the
system-wide brightness value.

Returns:

`Promise<boolean>`

A `Promise` that fulfils with `true` when the current activity is using the system-wide
brightness value, and `false` otherwise.

### `Brightness.requestPermissionsAsync()`

Asks the user to grant permissions for accessing system brightness.

Returns:

`Promise<PermissionResponse>`

A promise that fulfils with an object of type [PermissionResponse](#permissionresponse).

### `Brightness.restoreSystemBrightnessAsync()`

Only for:â

Android

Resets the brightness setting of the current activity to use the system-wide
brightness value rather than overriding it.

Returns:

`Promise<void>`

A `Promise` that fulfils when the setting has been successfully changed.

### `Brightness.setBrightnessAsync(brightnessValue)`

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| brightnessValue | `number` | A number between `0` and `1`, inclusive, representing the desired screen brightness. |

  

Sets the current screen brightness. On iOS, this setting will persist until the device is locked,
after which the screen brightness will revert to the user's default setting. On Android, this
setting only applies to the current activity; it will override the system brightness value
whenever your app is in the foreground.

Returns:

`Promise<void>`

A `Promise` that fulfils when the brightness has been successfully set.

### `Brightness.setSystemBrightnessAsync(brightnessValue)`

Only for:â

Android

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| brightnessValue | `number` | A number between `0` and `1`, inclusive, representing the desired screen brightness. |

  

Sets the global system screen brightness and changes the brightness mode to
`MANUAL`. Requires `SYSTEM_BRIGHTNESS` permissions.

Returns:

`Promise<void>`

A `Promise` that fulfils when the brightness has been successfully set.

### `Brightness.setSystemBrightnessModeAsync(brightnessMode)`

Only for:â

Android

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| brightnessMode | `BrightnessMode` | One of `BrightnessMode.MANUAL` or `BrightnessMode.AUTOMATIC`. The system brightness mode cannot be set to `BrightnessMode.UNKNOWN`. |

  

Sets the system brightness mode.

Returns:

`Promise<void>`

> Deprecated Use [`restoreSystemBrightnessAsync`](#brightnessrestoresystembrightnessasync) method instead.

### `Brightness.useSystemBrightnessAsync()`

Only for:â

Android

Returns:

`Promise<void>`

Event Subscriptions
-------------------

### `Brightness.addBrightnessListener(listener)`

Only for:â

iOS

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| listener | `(event: BrightnessEvent) => void` | A callback that is invoked when brightness (iOS) changes. The callback is provided a single argument that is an object with a `brightness` key. |

  

Subscribe to brightness (iOS) updates. The event fires whenever
the power mode is toggled.

On web and android the event never fires.

Returns:

`EventSubscription`

A `Subscription` object on which you can call `remove()` to unsubscribe from the listener.

Types
-----

### `BrightnessEvent`

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| brightness | `number` | A number between `0` and `1`, inclusive, representing the current screen brightness. |

### `PermissionExpiration`

Literal Type: `union`

Permission expiration time. Currently, all permissions are granted permanently.

Acceptable values are: `'never'` | `number`

### `PermissionHookOptions`

Literal Type: `union`

Acceptable values are: `PermissionHookBehavior` | `Options`

### `PermissionResponse`

An object obtained by permissions get and request functions.

| Property | Type | Description |
