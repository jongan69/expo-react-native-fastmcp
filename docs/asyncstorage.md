ðŸš§ AsyncStorage
==============

> **Removed.** Use one of the [community packages](https://reactnative.directory/?search=storage) instead.

`AsyncStorage` is an unencrypted, asynchronous, persistent, key-value storage system that is global to the app. It should be used instead of LocalStorage.

It is recommended that you use an abstraction on top of `AsyncStorage` instead of `AsyncStorage` directly for anything more than light usage since it operates globally.

On iOS, `AsyncStorage` is backed by native code that stores small values in a serialized dictionary and larger values in separate files. On Android, `AsyncStorage` will use either [RocksDB](https://rocksdb.org/) or SQLite based on what is available.

The `AsyncStorage` JavaScript code is a facade that provides a clear JavaScript API, real `Error` objects, and non-multi functions. Each method in the API returns a `Promise` object.

Importing the `AsyncStorage` library:

jsx

```
import {AsyncStorage} from 'react-native';  

```

Persisting data:

jsx

```
_storeData = async () => {  
  try {  
    await AsyncStorage.setItem(  
      '@MySuperStore:key',  
      'I like to save it.',  
    );  
  } catch (error) {  
    // Error saving data  
  }  
};  

```

Fetching data:

jsx

```
_retrieveData = async () => {  
  try {  
    const value = await AsyncStorage.getItem('TASKS');  
    if (value !== null) {  
      // We have data!!  
      console.log(value);  
    }  
  } catch (error) {  
    // Error retrieving data  
  }  
};  

```

jsx

```
static clear([callback]: ?(error: ?Error) => void)

**Parameters:**

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### `getAllKeys()`[â€‹](#getallkeys "Direct link to getallkeys")

jsx

```
static getAllKeys([callback]: ?(error: ?Error, keys: ?Array<string>) => void)  

```

Gets *all* keys known to your app; for all callers, libraries, etc. Returns a `Promise` object.

**Parameters:**

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Name Type Required Description|  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | callback `?(error: ?Error, keys: ?Array<string>) => void` No Function that will be called with all keys found and any error. | | | | | | | |

---

### `flushGetRequests()`[â€‹](#flushgetrequests "Direct link to flushgetrequests")

jsx

```
static flushGetRequests(): [object Object]  

```

Flushes any pending requests using a single batch call to get the data.

---

### `multiGet()`[â€‹](#multiget "Direct link to multiget")

jsx

```
static multiGet(keys: Array<string>, [callback]: ?(errors: ?Array<Error>, result: ?Array<Array<string>>) => void)  

```

This allows you to batch the fetching of items given an array of `key` inputs. Your callback will be invoked with an array of corresponding key-value pairs found:

```
multiGet(['k1', 'k2'], cb) -> cb([['k1', 'val1'], ['k2', 'val2']])  

```

The method returns a `Promise` object.

**Parameters:**

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Name Type Required Description|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | keys `Array<string>` Yes Array of key for the items to get.|  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | callback `?(errors: ?Array<Error>, result: ?Array<Array<string>>) => void` No Function that will be called with a key-value array of the results, plus an array of any key-specific errors found. | | | | | | | | | | | |

Example:

jsx

```
AsyncStorage.getAllKeys((err, keys) => {  
  AsyncStorage.multiGet(keys, (err, stores) => {  
    stores.map((result, i, store) => {  
      // get at each store's key/value so you can work with it  
      let key = store[i][0];  
      let value = store[i][1];  
    });  
  });  
});  

```

jsx

```
static multiSet(keyValuePairs: Array<Array<string>>, [callback]: ?(errors: ?Array<Error>) => void)  

```

Use this as a batch operation for storing multiple key-value pairs. When the operation completes you'll get a single callback with any errors:

```
multiSet([['k1', 'val1'], ['k2', 'val2']], cb);  

```

The method returns a `Promise` object.

Example:

jsx

```
let keys = ['k1', 'k2'];  
AsyncStorage.multiRemove(keys, err => {

  name: 'Chris',  
  age: 30,  
  traits: {hair: 'brown', eyes: 'brown'},  
};  
  
// first user, delta values  
let UID234_delta = {  
  age: 31,  
  traits: {eyes: 'blue', shoe_size: 10},  
};  
  
// second user, initial values

        let key = store[i][0];  
        let val = store[i][1];  
        console.log(key, val);  
      });  
    });  
  });  
});  
  
// Console log results:  
// => UID234 {"name":"Chris","age":31,"traits":{"shoe_size":10,"hair":"brown","eyes":"blue"}}
