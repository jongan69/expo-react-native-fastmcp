Expo AppleAuthentication
========================

[GitHub](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/sdk-52/packages/expo-apple-authentication)[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expo-apple-authentication)

A library that provides Sign-in with Apple capability for iOS.

[GitHub](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/sdk-52/packages/expo-apple-authentication)[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expo-apple-authentication)

iOS

tvOS

Bundled version:

~7.1.3

---

`expo-apple-authentication` provides Apple authentication for iOS. It does not yet support Android or web.

Any app that includes third-party authentication options must provide Apple authentication as an option to comply with App Store Review guidelines. For more information, see Apple authentication on the [Sign In with Apple](https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/) website.

Installation
------------

Terminal

Copy

`-Â``npx expo install expo-apple-authentication`

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

Configuration in app config
---------------------------

You can configure `expo-apple-authentication` using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([EAS Build](/build/introduction) or `npx expo run:[android|ios]`).
The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does not use EAS Build, then you'll need to manually configure the package.

### Setup iOS project

To enable the Sign In with Apple capability in your app, set the [`ios.usesAppleSignIn`](/versions/v52.0.0/config/app#usesapplesignin) property to `true` in your project's app config:

app.json

Copy

```
{
  "expo": {
    "ios": {
      "usesAppleSignIn": true
    }
  }
}

```

### Example app.json with config plugin

Running [EAS Build](/build/introduction) locally will use [iOS capabilities signing](/build-reference/ios-capabilities) to enable the required capabilities before building.

app.json

Copy

```
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": ["expo-apple-authentication"]
  }
}

```

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

Apps that don't use [EAS Build](/build/introduction) must [manually configure](/build-reference/ios-capabilities#manual-setup) the Apple Sign In capability for their bundle identifier.

If you enable the Apple Sign In capability through the [Apple Developer Console](/build-reference/ios-capabilities#apple-developer-console), then be sure to add the following entitlements in your ios/[app]/[app].entitlements file:

```
<key>com.apple.developer.applesignin</key>
<array>
  <string>Default</string>
</array>

```

Also, set `CFBundleAllowMixedLocalizations` to `true` in your ios/[app]/Info.plist to ensure the sign-in button uses the device locale.

Usage
-----

Apple Authentication Usage

Copy

Open in Snack

```
import * as AppleAuthentication from 'expo-apple-authentication';
import { View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <AppleAuthentication.AppleAuthenticationButton
        buttonType={AppleAuthentication.AppleAuthenticationButtonType.SIGN_IN}
        buttonStyle={AppleAuthentication.AppleAuthenticationButtonStyle.BLACK}
        cornerRadius={5}
        style={styles.button}
        onPress={async () => {
          try {
            const credential = await AppleAuthentication.signInAsync({
              requestedScopes: [
                AppleAuthentication.AppleAuthenticationScope.FULL_NAME,
                AppleAuthentication.AppleAuthenticationScope.EMAIL,
              ],
            });
            // signed in
          } catch (e) {
            if (e.code === 'ERR_REQUEST_CANCELED') {
              // handle that the user canceled the sign-in flow
            } else {
              // handle other errors
            }
          }
        }}
      />
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  button: {
    width: 200,
    height: 44,
  },
});

```

Development and testing
-----------------------

You can test this library in Expo Go on iOS without following any of the instructions above.
However, you'll need to add the config plugin to use this library if you are using EAS Build.
When you sign into Expo Go, the identifiers and values you receive will likely be different than what you'll receive in standalone apps.

You can do limited testing of this library on the iOS Simulator. However, not all methods will behave the same as on a device,
so we highly recommend testing on a real device when possible while developing.

Verifying the Response from Apple
---------------------------------

Apple's response includes a signed JWT with information about the user. To ensure that the response came from Apple,
you can cryptographically verify the signature with Apple's public key, which is published at <https://appleid.apple.com/auth/keys>.
This process is not specific to Expo.

API
---

```
import * as AppleAuthentication from 'expo-apple-authentication';

```

Component
---------

### `AppleAuthenticationButton`

iOS

tvOS

Type: `React.Element<AppleAuthenticationButtonProps>`

This component displays the proprietary "Sign In with Apple" / "Continue with Apple" button on
your screen. The App Store Guidelines require you to use this component to start the
authentication process instead of a custom button. Limited customization of the button is
available via the provided properties.

You should only attempt to render this if [`AppleAuthentication.isAvailableAsync()`](#appleauthenticationisavailableasync)
resolves to `true`. This component will render nothing if it is not available, and you will get
a warning in development mode (`__DEV__ === true`).

The properties of this component extend from `View`; however, you should not attempt to set
`backgroundColor` or `borderRadius` with the `style` property. This will not work and is against
the App Store Guidelines. Instead, you should use the `buttonStyle` property to choose one of the
predefined color styles and the `cornerRadius` property to change the border radius of the
button.

Make sure to attach height and width via the style props as without these styles, the button will
not appear on the screen.

> See: [Apple
> Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/asauthorizationappleidbutton)
> for more details.

AppleAuthenticationButtonProps

### `buttonStyle`

iOS

tvOS

Type: `AppleAuthenticationButtonStyle`

The Apple-defined color scheme to use to display the button.

### `buttonType`

iOS

tvOS

Type: `AppleAuthenticationButtonType`

The type of button text to display ("Sign In with Apple" vs. "Continue with Apple").

### `cornerRadius`

iOS

tvOS

Optionalââ¢âType: `number`

The border radius to use when rendering the button. This works similarly to
`style.borderRadius` in other Views.

### `onPress`

iOS

tvOS

Type: `() => void`

The method to call when the user presses the button. You should call [`AppleAuthentication.signInAsync`](#appleauthenticationisavailableasync)
in here.

### `style`

iOS

tvOS

Optionalââ¢âType: `StyleProp<Omit<ViewStyle, 'backgroundColor' | 'borderRadius'>>`

The custom style to apply to the button. Should not include `backgroundColor` or `borderRadius`
properties.

#### Inherited Props

* `ViewProps`

Methods
-------

### `AppleAuthentication.getCredentialStateAsync(user)`

iOS

tvOS

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| user | `string` | The unique identifier for the user whose credential state you'd like to check. This should come from the user field of an [`AppleAuthenticationCredential`](#appleauthenticationcredentialstate) object. |

  

Queries the current state of a user credential, to determine if it is still valid or if it has been revoked.

> Note: This method must be tested on a real device. On the iOS simulator it always throws an error.

Returns:

`Promise<AppleAuthenticationCredentialState>`

A promise that fulfills with an [`AppleAuthenticationCredentialState`](#appleauthenticationcredentialstate)
value depending on the state of the credential.

### `AppleAuthentication.isAvailableAsync()`

iOS

tvOS

Determine if the current device's operating system supports Apple authentication.

Returns:

`Promise<boolean>`

A promise that fulfills with `true` if the system supports Apple authentication, and `false` otherwise.

### `AppleAuthentication.refreshAsync(options)`

iOS

tvOS

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| options | `AppleAuthenticationRefreshOptions` | An [`AppleAuthenticationRefreshOptions`](#appleauthenticationrefreshoptions) object |

  

An operation that refreshes the logged-in userâs credentials.
Calling this method will show the sign in modal before actually refreshing the user credentials.

Returns:

`Promise<AppleAuthenticationCredential>`

A promise that fulfills with an [`AppleAuthenticationCredential`](#appleauthenticationcredential)
object after a successful authentication, and rejects with `ERR_REQUEST_CANCELED` if the user cancels the
refresh operation.

### `AppleAuthentication.signInAsync(options)`

iOS

tvOS

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| options(optional) | `AppleAuthenticationSignInOptions` | An optional [`AppleAuthenticationSignInOptions`](#appleauthenticationsigninoptions) object |

  

Sends a request to the operating system to initiate the Apple authentication flow, which will
present a modal to the user over your app and allow them to sign in.

You can request access to the user's full name and email address in this method, which allows you
to personalize your UI for signed in users. However, users can deny access to either or both
of these options at runtime.

Additionally, you will only receive Apple Authentication Credentials the first time users sign
into your app, so you must store it for later use. It's best to store this information either
server-side, or using [SecureStore](/versions/v52.0.0/sdk/securestore), so that the data persists across app installs.
You can use [`AppleAuthenticationCredential.user`](#appleauthenticationcredential) to identify
the user, since this remains the same for apps released by the same developer.

Returns:

`Promise<AppleAuthenticationCredential>`

A promise that fulfills with an [`AppleAuthenticationCredential`](#appleauthenticationcredential)
object after a successful authentication, and rejects with `ERR_REQUEST_CANCELED` if the user cancels the
sign-in operation.

### `AppleAuthentication.signOutAsync(options)`

iOS

tvOS

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| options | `AppleAuthenticationSignOutOptions` | An [`AppleAuthenticationSignOutOptions`](#appleauthenticationsignoutoptions) object |

  

An operation that ends the authenticated session.
Calling this method will show the sign in modal before actually signing the user out.

It is not recommended to use this method to sign out the user as it works counterintuitively.
Instead of using this method it is recommended to simply clear all the user's data collected
from using [`signInAsync`](/versions/v52.0.0/sdk#signinasync) or [`refreshAsync`](/versions/v52.0.0/sdk#refreshasync) methods.

Returns:

`Promise<AppleAuthenticationCredential>`

A promise that fulfills with an [`AppleAuthenticationCredential`](#appleauthenticationcredential)
object after a successful authentication, and rejects with `ERR_REQUEST_CANCELED` if the user cancels the
sign-out operation.

Event Subscriptions
-------------------

### `AppleAuthentication.addRevokeListener(listener)`

iOS

tvOS

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| listener | `() => void` |

  

Returns:

`EventSubscription`

Types
-----

### `AppleAuthenticationCredential`

iOS

tvOS

The object type returned from a successful call to [`AppleAuthentication.signInAsync()`](#appleauthenticationsigninasyncoptions),
[`AppleAuthentication.refreshAsync()`](#appleauthenticationrefreshasyncoptions), or [`AppleAuthentication.signOutAsync()`](#appleauthenticationsignoutasyncoptions)
which contains all of the pertinent user and credential information.

> See: [Apple
> Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/asauthorizationappleidcredential)
> for more details.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| authorizationCode | `string | null` | A short-lived session token used by your app for proof of authorization when interacting with the app's server counterpart. Unlike `user`, this is ephemeral and will change each session. |
| email | `string | null` | The user's email address. Might not be present if you didn't request the `EMAIL` scope. May also be null if this is not the first time the user has signed into your app. If the user chose to withhold their email address, this field will instead contain an obscured email address with an Apple domain. |
| fullName | `AppleAuthenticationFullName | null` | The user's name. May be `null` or contain `null` values if you didn't request the `FULL_NAME` scope, if the user denied access, or if this is not the first time the user has signed into your app. |
| identityToken | `string | null` | A JSON Web Token (JWT) that securely communicates information about the user to your app. |
| realUserStatus | `AppleAuthenticationUserDetectionStatus` | A value that indicates whether the user appears to the system to be a real person. |
| state | `string | null` | An arbitrary string that your app provided as `state` in the request that generated the credential. Used to verify that the response was from the request you made. Can be used to avoid replay attacks. If you did not provide `state` when making the sign-in request, this field will be `null`. |
| user | `string` | An identifier associated with the authenticated user. You can use this to check if the user is still authenticated later. This is stable and can be shared across apps released under the same development team. The same user will have a different identifier for apps released by other developers. |

### `AppleAuthenticationFullName`

iOS

tvOS

An object representing the tokenized portions of the user's full name. Any of all of the fields
may be `null`. Only applicable fields that the user has allowed your app to access will be nonnull.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| familyName | `string | null` | - |
| givenName | `string | null` | - |
