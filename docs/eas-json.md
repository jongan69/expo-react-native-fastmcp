Configure EAS Submit with eas.json
==================================

[Edit this page](https://github.com/expo/expo/edit/main/docs/pages/submit/eas-json.mdx)

Learn how to configure your project for EAS Submit with eas.json.

[Edit this page](https://github.com/expo/expo/edit/main/docs/pages/submit/eas-json.mdx)

---

eas.json is the configuration file for EAS CLI and services. It is generated when the [`eas build:configure` command](/build/setup#configure-the-project) runs for the first time in your project and is located next to package.json at the root of your project. Even though eas.json is not mandatory for using EAS Submit, it makes your life easier if you need to switch between different configurations.

Production profile
------------------

Running `eas submit` without specifying a profile name will use the `production` profile if it is already defined in eas.json to configure the submission. If no values exist in the `production` profile, EAS CLI will prompt you to provide the values interactively.

The `production` profile shown below is required to run Android and iOS submissions in a CI/CD process, like with [EAS Workflows](/eas/workflows):

eas.json

Copy

```
{
  "cli": {
    "version": ">= 0.34.0"
  },
  "submit": {
    "production": {
      "android": {
        "serviceAccountKeyPath": "../path/to/api-xxx-yyy-zzz.json",
        "track": "internal"
      },
      "ios": {
        "ascAppId": "your-app-store-connect-app-id"
      }
    }
  }
}

```

Learn more about the values you can set with the [Android specific options](/eas/json#android-specific-options) and the [iOS specific options](/eas/json#ios-specific-options). You can also learn how to submit to the [Apple App Store](/submit/ios) and the [Google Play Store](/submit/android).

Multiple profiles
-----------------

The JSON object under `submit` can contain multiple submit profiles. Each profile under `submit` can have an arbitrary name as shown in the example below:

eas.json

Copy

```
{
  "cli": {
    "version": "SEMVER_RANGE",
    "requireCommit": boolean
  },
  "build": {
    // EAS Build configuration
    %%placeholder-start%%... %%placeholder-end%%
  },
  "submit": {
    "SUBMIT_PROFILE_NAME_1": {
      "android": {
        ...ANDROID_OPTIONS
      },
      "ios": {
        ...IOS_OPTIONS
      }
    },
    "SUBMIT_PROFILE_NAME_2": {
      "extends": "SUBMIT_PROFILE_NAME_1",
      "android": {
        ...ANDROID_OPTIONS
      }
    },
    %%placeholder-start%%... %%placeholder-end%%
  }
}

```

When you select a build for submission, it chooses the profile that is used for the selected build. If the profile does not exist, it selects the default `production` profile.

You can also use EAS CLI to pick up another `submit` profile by specifying it with a parameter, for example:

Terminal

Copy

`# Replace the <profile-name> with a submit profile from the eas.json`

`-Ã‚``eas submit --platform ios --profile <profile-name>`

Share configuration between `submit` profiles
---------------------------------------------

A `submit` profile can extend another profile using the `extends` key.

For example, in the `preview` profile you may have `"extends": "production"`. This makes the `preview` profile inherit the configuration of the `production` profile.

You can keep chaining profile extensions up to the depth of 5 as long as you avoid making circular dependencies.
