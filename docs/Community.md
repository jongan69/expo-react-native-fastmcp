React Native

Meta supported. Community driven.
=================================

Meta released React Native in 2015 and has been maintaining it ever since.

In 2018, React Native had the [2nd highest](https://octoverse.github.com/2018/projects#repositories) number of contributors for any repository in GitHub. Today, React Native is supported by contributions from individuals and companies around the world including [Callstack](https://callstack.com/), [Expo](https://expo.io/), [Infinite Red](https://infinite.red/), [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) and [Software Mansion](https://swmansion.com/).

Our community is always shipping exciting new projects and exploring platforms beyond Android and iOS with repos like [React Native Windows](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows#readme), [React Native macOS](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos#readme) and [React Native Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web#readme).

React Native is being used in thousands of apps, but it's likely you've already used it in one of these apps:
