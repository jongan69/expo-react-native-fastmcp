React Native versions
=====================

Open source React Native releases follow a release train that is coordinated on GitHub through the [`react-native-releases`](https://github.com/reactwg/react-native-releases/discussions) repository. New releases are created off the `main` branch of [`facebook/react-native`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native). They will follow a Release Candidate process to allow contributors like yourself to [verify the changes](/docs/upgrading) and to identify any issues by [writing clear, actionable bug reports](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues). Eventually, the release candidate will be promoted to stable.

Next version (Unreleased)
-------------------------

To see what changes are coming and provide better feedback to React Native contributors, use the latest release candidate when possible. Changes introduced in a release candidate will have been shipped to production Facebook apps for over two weeks by the time the release candidate is cut.
