ðŸš§ SegmentedControlIOS
=====================

> **Removed from React Native.** Use one of the [community packages](https://reactnative.directory/?search=segmentedcontrol) instead.

Uses `SegmentedControlIOS` to render a UISegmentedControl iOS.

#### Programmatically changing selected index[â€‹](#programmatically-changing-selected-index "Direct link to Programmatically changing selected index")

The selected index can be changed on the fly by assigning the selectedIndex prop to a state variable, then changing that variable. Note that the state variable would need to be updated as the user selects a value and changes the index, as shown in the example below.
