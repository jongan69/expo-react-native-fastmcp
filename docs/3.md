Product Manager at Shoutem

The React Native monthly meeting continues! On this session, we were joined by [Infinite Red](https://infinite.red/), great minds behind [Chain React, the React Native Conference](https://infinite.red/ChainReactConf). As most of the people here were presenting talks at Chain React, we pushed the meeting to a week later. Talks from the conference have been [posted online](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFHvL21g9bk3RxJ1Ut5nR_uTZFVOxu522) and I encourage you to check them out. So, let's see what our teams are up to.

Teams[​](#teams "Direct link to Teams")
---------------------------------------

On this second meeting, we had 9 teams join us:

* [Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb)
* [Callstack](https://github.com/callstack-io)
* [Expo](https://github.com/expo)
* [Facebook](https://github.com/facebook)
* [GeekyAnts](https://github.com/GeekyAnts)
* [Infinite Red](https://github.com/infinitered)
* [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft)
* [Shoutem](https://github.com/shoutem)
* [Wix](https://github.com/wix)

Notes[​](#notes "Direct link to Notes")
---------------------------------------

Here are the notes from each team:

### Airbnb[​](#airbnb "Direct link to Airbnb")

* Check out the [Airbnb repository](https://github.com/airbnb) for React Native related projects.

### Callstack[​](#callstack "Direct link to Callstack")

* [Mike Grabowski](https://github.com/grabbou) has been managing React Native's monthly releases as always, including a few betas that were pushed out. In particular, working on getting a v0.43.5 build published to npm since it unblocks Windows users!
* Slow but consistent work is happening on [Haul](https://github.com/callstack-io/haul). There is a pull request that adds HMR, and other improvements have shipped. Recently got a few industry leaders to adopt it. Possibly planning to start a full-time paid work in that area.
* [Michał Pierzchała](https://twitter.com/thymikee) from the [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) team has joined us at Callstack this month. He will help maintain [Haul](https://github.com/callstack-io/haul) and possibly work on [Metro Bundler](https://github.com/facebook/metro) and [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest).
* [Satyajit Sahoo](https://twitter.com/satya164) is now with us, yay!
* Got a bunch of cool stuff coming up from our OSS department. In particular, working on bringing Material Palette API to React Native. Planning to finally release our native iOS kit which is aimed to provide 1:1 look & feel of native components.

### Expo[​](#expo "Direct link to Expo")

* Recently launched [Native Directory](https://native.directory) to help with discoverability and evaluation of libraries in React Native ecosystem. The problem: lots of libraries, hard to test, need to manually apply heuristics and not immediately obvious which ones are just the best ones that you should use. It's also hard to know if something is compatible with CRNA/Expo. So Native Directory tries to solve these problems. Check it out and [add your library](https://github.com/react-community/native-directory) to it. The list of libraries is in [here](https://github.com/react-community/native-directory/blob/master/react-native-libraries.json). This is just our first pass of it, and we want this to be owned and run by the community, not just Expo folks. So please pitch in if you think this is valuable and want to make it better!
* Added initial support for installing npm packages in [Snack](https://snack.expo.io/) with Expo SDK 19. Let us know if you run into any issues with it, we are still working through some bugs. Along with Native Directory, this should make it easy to test libraries that have only JS dependencies, or dependencies included in [Expo SDK](https://github.com/expo/expo-sdk). Try it out:
  + [react-native-modal](https://snack.expo.io/ByBCD_2r-)
  + [react-native-animatable](https://snack.expo.io/SJfJguhrW)
  + [react-native-calendars](https://snack.expo.io/HkoXUdhr-)
* [Released Expo SDK19](https://blog.expo.io/expo-sdk-v19-0-0-is-now-available-821a62b58d3d) with a bunch of improvements across the board, and we're now using the [updated Android JSC](https://github.com/SoftwareMansion/jsc-android-buildscripts).
* Working on a guide in docs with [Alexander Kotliarskyi](https://github.com/frantic) with a list of tips on how to improve the user experience of your app. Please join in and add to the list or help write some of it!
  + Issue: [#14979](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/14979)
  + Initial pull request: [#14993](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/14993)
* Continuing to work on: audio/video, camera, gestures (with Software Mansion, `react-native-gesture-handler`), GL camera integration and hoping to land some of these for the first time in SDK20 (August), and significant improvements to others by then as well. We're just getting started on building infrastructure into the Expo client for background work (geolocation, audio, handling notifications, etc.).
* [Adam Miskiewicz](https://twitter.com/skevy) has made some nice progress on imitating the transitions from [UINavigationController](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uinavigationcontroller) in [react-navigation](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation). Check out an earlier version of it in [his tweet](https://twitter.com/skevy/status/884932473070735361) - release coming with it soon. Also check out `MaskedViewIOS` which he [upstreamed](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/8ea6cea39a3db6171dd74838a6eea4631cf42bba). If you have the skills and desire to implement `MaskedView` for Android that would be awesome!

### Facebook[​](#facebook "Direct link to Facebook")

* Facebook is internally exploring being able to embed native [ComponentKit](https://componentkit.org/) and [Litho](https://fblitho.com/) components inside of React Native.
* Contributions to React Native are very welcome! If you are wondering how you can contribute, the ["How to Contribute" guide](https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) describes our development process and lays out the steps to send your first pull request. There are other ways to contribute that do not require writing code, such as by triaging issues or updating the docs.
  + At the time of writing, React Native has **635** [open issues](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues) and **249** [open pull requests](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pulls). This is overwhelming for our maintainers, and when things get fixed internally, it is difficult to ensure the relevant tasks are updated.
  + We are unsure what the best approach is to handle this while keeping the community satisfied. Some (but not all!) options include closing stale issues, giving significantly more people permissions to manage issues, and automatically closing issues that do not follow the issue template. We wrote a "What to Expect from Maintainers" guide to set expectations and avoid surprises. If you have ideas on how we can make this experience better for maintainers as well as ensuring people opening issues and pull requests feel heard and valued, please let us know!

### GeekyAnts[​](#geekyants "Direct link to GeekyAnts")

* We demoed the Designer Tool which works with React Native files on Chain React. Many attendees signed up for the waiting list.
* We are also looking at other cross-platform solutions like [Google Flutter](https://flutter.io/) (a major comparison coming along), [Kotlin Native](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native), and [Apache Weex](https://weex.incubator.apache.org/) to understand the architectural differences and what we can learn from them to improve the overall performance of React Native.
* Switched to [react-navigation](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation) for most of our apps, which has improved the overall performance.
* Also, announced [NativeBase Market](https://market.nativebase.io/) - A marketplace for React Native components and apps (for and by the developers).

### Infinite Red[​](#infinite-red "Direct link to Infinite Red")

* We want to introduce the [Reactotron](https://github.com/infinitered/reactotron). Check out the [introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPBRfxswDjA). We'll be adding more features very soon!
* Organised Chain React Conference. It was awesome, thanks all for coming! [The videos are now online!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFHvL21g9bk3RxJ1Ut5nR_uTZFVOxu522)

### Microsoft[​](#microsoft "Direct link to Microsoft")

* [CodePush](https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push) has now been integrated into [Mobile Center](https://mobile.azure.com/). Existing users will have no change in their workflow.
  + Some people have reported an issue with duplicate apps - they already had an app on Mobile Center. We are working on resolving them, but if you have two apps, let us know, and we can merge them for you.
* Mobile Center now supports Push Notifications for CodePush. We also showed how a combination of Notifications and CodePush could be used for A/B testing apps - something unique to the ReactNative architecture.
* [VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) has a known debugging issue with ReactNative - the next release of the extension in a couple of days will be fixing the issue.
* Since there are many other teams also working on React Native inside Microsoft, we will work on getting better representation from all the groups for the next meeting.

### Shoutem[​](#shoutem "Direct link to Shoutem")

* Finished the process of making the React Native development easier on [Shoutem](https://shoutem.github.io/). You can use all the standard `react-native` commands when developing apps on Shoutem.
* We did a lot of work trying to figure out how to best approach the profiling on React Native. A big chunk of [documentation](/docs/performance) is outdated, and we'll do our best to create a pull request on the official docs or at least write some of our conclusions in a blog post.
* Switching our navigation solution to [react-navigation](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation), so we might have some feedback soon.
* We released [a new HTML component](https://github.com/shoutem/ui/tree/develop/html) in our toolkit which transforms the raw HTML to the React Native components tree.

### Wix[​](#wix "Direct link to Wix")

* We started working on a pull request to [Metro Bundler](https://github.com/facebook/metro) with [react-native-repackager](https://github.com/wix/react-native-repackager) capabilities. We updated react-native-repackager to support RN 44 (which we use in production). We are using it for our mocking infrastructure for [detox](https://github.com/wix/detox).
* We have been covering the Wix app in detox tests for the last three weeks. It's an amazing learning experience of how to reduce manual QA in an app of this scale (over 40 engineers). We have resolved several issues with detox as a result, a new version was just published. I am happy to report that we are living up to the "zero flakiness policy" and the tests are passing consistently so far.
* Detox for Android is moving forward nicely. We are getting significant help from the community. We are expecting an initial version in about two weeks.
* [DetoxInstruments](https://github.com/wix/detoxinstruments), our performance testing tool, is getting a little bigger than we originally intended. We are now planning to turn it into a standalone tool that will not be tightly coupled to detox. It will allow investigating the performance of iOS apps in general. It will also be integrated with detox so we can run automated tests on performance metrics.

Next session[​](#next-session "Direct link to Next session")
------------------------------------------------------------

The next session is scheduled for August 16, 2017. As this was only our second meeting, we'd like to know how do these notes benefit the React Native community. Feel free to ping me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/TomislavTenodi) if you have any suggestion on how we should improve the output of the meeting.

Product Manager at Shoutem

At [Shoutem](https://shoutem.github.io/), we've been fortunate enough to work with React Native from its very beginnings. We decided we wanted to be part of the amazing community from day one. Soon enough, we realized it's almost impossible to keep up with the pace the community was growing and improving. That's why we decided to organize a monthly meeting where all major React Native contributors can briefly present what their efforts and plans are.

Monthly meetings[​](#monthly-meetings "Direct link to Monthly meetings")
------------------------------------------------------------------------

We had our first session of the monthly meeting on June 14, 2017. The mission for React Native Monthly is simple and straightforward: **improve the React Native community**. Presenting teams' efforts eases collaboration between teams done offline.

Teams[​](#teams "Direct link to Teams")
---------------------------------------

On the first meeting, we had 8 teams join us:

* [Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb)
* [Callstack](https://github.com/callstack-io)
* [Expo](https://github.com/expo)
* [Facebook](https://github.com/facebook)
* [GeekyAnts](https://github.com/GeekyAnts)
* [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft)
* [Shoutem](https://github.com/shoutem)
* [Wix](https://github.com/wix)

We hope to have more core contributors join the upcoming sessions!

Notes[​](#notes "Direct link to Notes")
---------------------------------------

As teams' plans might be of interest to a broader audience, we'll be sharing them here, on the React Native blog. So, here they are:

### Airbnb[​](#airbnb "Direct link to Airbnb")

* Plans to add some A11y (accessibility) APIs to `View` and the `AccessibilityInfo` native module.
* Will be investigating adding some APIs to native modules on Android to allow for specifying threads for them to run on.
* Have been investigating potential initialization performance improvements.
* Have been investigating some more sophisticated bundling strategies to use on top of "unbundle".

### Callstack[​](#callstack "Direct link to Callstack")

* Looking into improving the release process by using [Detox](https://github.com/wix/detox) for E2E testing. Pull request should land soon.
* Blob pull request they have been working on has been merged, subsequent pull requests coming up.
* Increasing [Haul](https://github.com/callstack-io/haul) adoption across internal projects to see how it performs compared to [Metro Bundler](https://github.com/facebook/metro-bundler). Working on better multi-threaded performance with the webpack team.
* Internally, they have implemented a better infrastructure to manage open source projects. Plans to be getting more stuff out in upcoming weeks.
* The React Native Europe conference is coming along, nothing interesting yet, but y'all invited!
* Stepped back from [react-navigation](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation) for a while to investigate alternatives (especially native navigations).

### Expo[​](#expo "Direct link to Expo")

* Working on making it possible to install npm modules in [Snack](https://snack.expo.io/), will be useful for libraries to add examples to documentation.
* Working with [Krzysztof](https://github.com/kmagiera) and other people at [Software Mansion](https://github.com/software-mansion) on a JSC update on Android and a gesture handling library.
* [Adam Miskiewicz](https://github.com/skevy) is transitioning his focus towards [react-navigation](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation).
* [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app) is in the [Getting Started guide](/docs/getting-started) in the docs. Expo wants to encourage library authors to explain clearly whether their lib works with CRNA or not, and if so, explain how to set it up.

### Facebook[​](#facebook "Direct link to Facebook")

* React Native's packager is now [Metro Bundler](https://github.com/facebook/metro), in an independent repo. The Metro Bundler team in London is excited to address the needs of the community, improve modularity for additional use-cases beyond React Native, and increase responsiveness on issues and PRs.
* In the coming months, the React Native team will work on refining the APIs of primitive components. Expect improvements in layout quirks, accessibility, and flow typing.
* The React Native team also plans on improving core modularity this year, by refactoring to fully support 3rd party platforms such as Windows and macOS.

### GeekyAnts[​](#geekyants "Direct link to GeekyAnts")

* The team is working on a UI/UX design app (codename: Builder) which directly works with `.js` files. Right now, it supports only React Native. It’s similar to Adobe XD and Sketch.
* The team is working hard so that you can load up an existing React Native app in the editor, make changes (visually, as a designer) and save the changes directly to the JS file.
* Folks are trying to bridge the gap between Designers and Developers and bring them on the same repo.
* Also, [NativeBase](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/NativeBase) recently reached 5,000 GitHub stars.

### Microsoft[​](#microsoft "Direct link to Microsoft")

* [CodePush](https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push) has now been integrated into [Mobile Center](https://mobile.azure.com/). This is the first step in providing a much more integrated experience with distribution, analytics and other services. See their announcement [here](https://microsoft.github.io/code-push/articles/CodePushOnMobileCenter.html).
* [VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) has a bug with debugging, they are working on fixing that right now and will have a new build.
* Investigating [Detox](https://github.com/wix/detox) for Integration testing, looking at JSC Context to get variables alongside crash reports.

### Shoutem[​](#shoutem "Direct link to Shoutem")

* Making it easier to work on Shoutem apps with tools from the React Native community. You will be able to use all the React Native commands to run the apps created on [Shoutem](https://shoutem.github.io/).
* Investigating profiling tools for React Native. They had a lot of problems setting it up and they will write some of the insights they discovered along the way.
* Shoutem is working on making it easier to integrate React Native with existing native apps. They will document the concept that they developed internally in the company, in order to get the feedback from the community.

### Wix[​](#wix "Direct link to Wix")

* Working internally to adopt [Detox](https://github.com/wix/detox) to move significant parts of the Wix app to "zero manual QA". As a result, Detox is being used heavily in a production setting by dozens of developers and maturing rapidly.
* Working to add support to the [Metro Bundler](https://github.com/facebook/metro) for overriding any file extension during the build. Instead of just "ios" and "android", it would support any custom extension like "e2e" or "detox". Plans to use this for E2E mocking. There's already a library out called [react-native-repackager](https://github.com/wix/react-native-repackager), now working on a PR.
* Investigating automation of performance tests. This is a new repo called [DetoxInstruments](https://github.com/wix/DetoxInstruments). You can take a look, it's being developed open source.
* Working with a contributor from KPN on Detox for Android and supporting real devices.
* Thinking about "Detox as a platform" to allow building other tools that need to automate the simulator/device. An example is [Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/react-native-storybook) for React Native or Ram's idea for integration testing.

Next session[​](#next-session "Direct link to Next session")
------------------------------------------------------------

Meetings will be held every four weeks. The next session is scheduled for July 12, 2017. As we just started with this meeting, we'd like to know how do these notes benefit the React Native community. Feel free to ping me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/TomislavTenodi) if you have any suggestion on what we should cover in the following sessions, or how we should improve the output of the meeting.

[Better List Views in React Native](/blog/2017/03/13/better-list-views)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

March 13, 2017 · 6 min read

Many of you have started playing with some of our new List components already after our [teaser announcement in the community group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/react.native.community/permalink/921378591331053), but we are officially announcing them today! No more `ListView`s or `DataSource`s, stale rows, ignored bugs, or excessive memory consumption - with the latest React Native March 2017 release candidate (`0.43-rc.1`) you can pick from the new suite of components what best fits your use-case, with great perf and feature sets out of the box:

### [`<FlatList>`](/docs/flatlist)[​](#flatlist "Direct link to flatlist")

This is the workhorse component for simple, performant lists. Provide an array of data and a `renderItem` function and you're good to go:

```
<FlatList  
  data={[{title: 'Title Text', key: 'item1'}, ...]}  
  renderItem={({item}) => <ListItem title={item.title} />}  
/>  

```

### [`<SectionList>`](/docs/sectionlist)[​](#sectionlist "Direct link to sectionlist")

If you want to render a set of data broken into logical sections, maybe with section headers (e.g. in an alphabetical address book), and potentially with heterogeneous data and rendering (such as a profile view with some buttons followed by a composer, then a photo grid, then a friend grid, and finally a list of stories), this is the way to go.

```
<SectionList  
  renderItem={({item}) => <ListItem title={item.title} />}  
  renderSectionHeader={({section}) => <H1 title={section.key} />}  
  sections={[ // homogeneous rendering between sections  
    {data: [...], key: ...},  
    {data: [...], key: ...},  
    {data: [...], key: ...},  
  ]}  
/>  
  
<SectionList  
  sections={[ // heterogeneous rendering between sections  
    {data: [...], key: ..., renderItem: ...},  
    {data: [...], key: ..., renderItem: ...},  
    {data: [...], key: ..., renderItem: ...},  
  ]}  
/>  

```

### [`<VirtualizedList>`](/docs/virtualizedlist)[​](#virtualizedlist "Direct link to virtualizedlist")

The implementation behind the scenes with a more flexible API. Especially handy if your data is not in a plain array (e.g. an immutable list).

Features[​](#features "Direct link to Features")
------------------------------------------------

Lists are used in many contexts, so we packed the new components full of features to handle the majority of use cases out of the box:

* Scroll loading (`onEndReached`).
* Pull to refresh (`onRefresh` / `refreshing`).
* [Configurable](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/Libraries/CustomComponents/Lists/ViewabilityHelper.js) viewability (VPV) callbacks (`onViewableItemsChanged` / `viewabilityConfig`).
* Horizontal mode (`horizontal`).
* Intelligent item and section separators.
* Multi-column support (`numColumns`)
* `scrollToEnd`, `scrollToIndex`, and `scrollToItem`
* Better Flow typing.

### Some Caveats[​](#some-caveats "Direct link to Some Caveats")

* The internal state of item subtrees is not preserved when content scrolls out of the render window. Make sure all your data is captured in the item data or external stores like Flux, Redux, or Relay.
* These components are based on `PureComponent` which means that they will not re-render if `props` remains shallow-equal. Make sure that everything your `renderItem` function depends on directly is passed as a prop that is not `===` after updates, otherwise your UI may not update on changes. This includes the `data` prop and parent component state. For example:

  ```
  <FlatList  
    data={this.state.data}  
    renderItem={({item}) => (  
      <MyItem  
        item={item}  
        onPress={() =>  
          this.setState(oldState => ({  
            selected: {  
              // New instance breaks `===`  
              ...oldState.selected, // copy old data  
              [item.key]: !oldState.selected[item.key], // toggle  
            },  
          }))  
        }  
        selected={  
          !!this.state.selected[item.key] // renderItem depends on state  
        }  
      />  
    )}  
    selected={  
      // Can be any prop that doesn't collide with existing props  
      this.state.selected // A change to selected should re-render FlatList  
    }  
  />  

  ```
* In order to constrain memory and enable smooth scrolling, content is rendered asynchronously offscreen. This means it's possible to scroll faster than the fill rate and momentarily see blank content. This is a tradeoff that can be adjusted to suit the needs of each application, and we are working on improving it behind the scenes.
* By default, these new lists look for a `key` prop on each item and use that for the React key. Alternatively, you can provide a custom `keyExtractor` prop.

Performance[​](#performance "Direct link to Performance")
---------------------------------------------------------

Besides simplifying the API, the new list components also have significant performance enhancements, the main one being nearly constant memory usage for any number of rows. This is done by 'virtualizing' elements that are outside of the render window by completely unmounting them from the component hierarchy and reclaiming the JS memory from the react components, along with the native memory from the shadow tree and the UI views. This has a catch which is that internal component state will not be preserved, so **make sure you track any important state outside of the components themselves, e.g. in Relay or Redux or Flux store.**

Limiting the render window also reduces the amount of work that needs to be done by React and the native platform, e.g from view traversals. Even if you are rendering the last of a million elements, with these new lists there is no need to iterate through all those elements in order to render. You can even jump to the middle with `scrollToIndex` without excessive rendering.

We've also made some improvements with scheduling which should help with application responsiveness. Items at the edge of the render window are rendered infrequently and at a lower priority after any active gestures or animations or other interactions have completed.

Advanced Usage[​](#advanced-usage "Direct link to Advanced Usage")
------------------------------------------------------------------

Unlike `ListView`, all items in the render window are re-rendered any time any props change. Often this is fine because the windowing reduces the number of items to a constant number, but if your items are on the complex side, you should make sure to follow React best practices for performance and use `React.PureComponent` and/or `shouldComponentUpdate` as appropriate within your components to limit re-renders of the recursive subtree.

If you can calculate the height of your rows without rendering them, you can improve the user experience by providing the `getItemLayout` prop. This makes it much smoother to scroll to specific items with e.g. `scrollToIndex`, and will improve the scroll indicator UI because the height of the content can be determined without rendering it.

If you have an alternative data type, like an immutable list, `<VirtualizedList>` is the way to go. It takes a `getItem` prop that lets you return the item data for any given index and has looser flow typing.

There are also a bunch of parameters you can tweak if you have an unusual use case. For example, you can use `windowSize` to trade off memory usage vs. user experience, `maxToRenderPerBatch` to adjust fill rate vs. responsiveness, `onEndReachedThreshold` to control when scroll loading happens, and more.

Future Work[​](#future-work "Direct link to Future Work")
---------------------------------------------------------

* Migration of existing surfaces (ultimately deprecation of `ListView`).
* More features as we see/hear the need (let us know!).
* Sticky section header support.
* More performance optimizations.
* Support functional item components with state.

[idx: The Existential Function](/blog/2017/03/13/idx-the-existential-function)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At Facebook, we often need to access deeply nested values in data structures fetched with GraphQL. On the way to accessing these deeply nested values, it is common for one or more intermediate fields to be nullable. These intermediate fields may be null for a variety of reasons, from failed privacy checks to the mere fact that null happens to be the most flexible way to represent non-fatal errors.

Unfortunately, accessing these deeply nested values is currently tedious and verbose.

```
props.user &&  
  props.user.friends &&  
  props.user.friends[0] &&  
  props.user.friends[0].friends;  

```

There is [an ECMAScript proposal to introduce the existential operator](https://github.com/claudepache/es-optional-chaining) which will make this much more convenient. But until a time when that proposal is finalized, we want a solution that improves our quality of life, maintains existing language semantics, and encourages type safety with Flow.

We came up with an existential *function* we call `idx`.

```
idx(props, _ => _.user.friends[0].friends);  

```

The invocation in this code snippet behaves similarly to the boolean expression in the code snippet above, except with significantly less repetition. The `idx` function takes exactly two arguments:

* Any value, typically an object or array into which you want to access a nested value.
* A function that receives the first argument and accesses a nested value on it.

In theory, the `idx` function will try-catch errors that are the result of accessing properties on null or undefined. If such an error is caught, it will return either null or undefined. (And you can see how this might be implemented in [idx.js](https://github.com/facebookincubator/idx/blob/master/packages/idx/src/idx.js).)

In practice, try-catching every nested property access is slow, and differentiating between specific kinds of TypeErrors is fragile. To deal with these shortcomings, we created a Babel plugin that transforms the above `idx` invocation into the following expression:

```
props.user == null  
  ? props.user  
  : props.user.friends == null  
    ? props.user.friends  
    : props.user.friends[0] == null  
      ? props.user.friends[0]  
      : props.user.friends[0].friends;  

```

Finally, we added a custom Flow type declaration for `idx` that allows the traversal in the second argument to be properly type-checked while permitting nested access on nullable properties.

The function, Babel plugin, and Flow declaration are now [available on GitHub](https://github.com/facebookincubator/idx). They are used by installing the **idx** and **babel-plugin-idx** npm packages, and adding “idx” to the list of plugins in your `.babelrc` file.

[Introducing Create React Native App](/blog/2017/03/13/introducing-create-react-native-app)

Software Engineer at Expo

Today we’re announcing [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app): a new tool that makes it significantly easier to get started with a React Native project! It’s heavily inspired by the design of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and is the product of a collaboration between [Facebook](https://code.facebook.com) and [Expo](https://expo.io) (formerly Exponent).

Many developers struggle with installing and configuring React Native’s current native build dependencies, especially for Android. With Create React Native App, there’s no need to use Xcode or Android Studio, and you can develop for your iOS device using Linux or Windows. This is accomplished using the Expo app, which loads and runs CRNA projects written in pure JavaScript without compiling any native code.

Try creating a new project (replace with suitable yarn commands if you have it installed):

```
$ npm i -g create-react-native-app  
$ create-react-native-app my-project  
$ cd my-project  
$ npm start  

```

This will start the React Native packager and print a QR code. Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) to load your JavaScript. Calls to `console.log` are forwarded to your terminal. You can make use of any standard React Native APIs as well as the [Expo SDK](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/).

What about native code?[​](#what-about-native-code "Direct link to What about native code?")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many React Native projects have Java or Objective-C/Swift dependencies that need to be compiled. The Expo app does include APIs for camera, video, contacts, and more, and bundles popular libraries like [Airbnb’s react-native-maps](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/map-view/), or [Facebook authentication](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/facebook/). However if you need a native code dependency that Expo doesn’t bundle then you’ll probably need to have your own build configuration for it. Just like Create React App, “ejecting” is supported by CRNA.

You can run `npm run eject` to get a project very similar to what `react-native init` would generate. At that point you’ll need Xcode and/or Android Studio just as you would if you started with `react-native init` , adding libraries with `react-native link` will work, and you’ll have full control over the native code compilation process.

Questions? Feedback?[​](#questions-feedback "Direct link to Questions? Feedback?")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create React Native App is now stable enough for general use, which means we’re very eager to hear about your experience using it! You can find me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/dika10sune) or open an issue on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app). Pull requests are very welcome!

[Using Native Driver for Animated](/blog/2017/02/14/using-native-driver-for-animated)

For the past year, we've been working on improving performance of animations that use the Animated library. Animations are very important to create a beautiful user experience but can also be hard to do right. We want to make it easy for developers to create performant animations without having to worry about some of their code causing it to lag.

What is this?[​](#what-is-this "Direct link to What is this?")
--------------------------------------------------------------

The Animated API was designed with a very important constraint in mind, it is serializable. This means we can send everything about the animation to native before it has even started and allows native code to perform the animation on the UI thread without having to go through the bridge on every frame. It is very useful because once the animation has started, the JS thread can be blocked and the animation will still run smoothly. In practice this can happen a lot because user code runs on the JS thread and React renders can also lock JS for a long time.

A bit of history...[​](#a-bit-of-history "Direct link to A bit of history...")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project started about a year ago, when Expo built the li.st app on Android. [Krzysztof Magiera](https://twitter.com/kzzzf) was contracted to build the initial implementation on Android. It ended up working well and li.st was the first app to ship with native driven animations using Animated. A few months later, [Brandon Withrow](https://github.com/buba447) built the initial implementation on iOS. After that, [Ryan Gomba](https://twitter.com/ryangomba) and myself worked on adding missing features like support for `Animated.event` as well as squash bugs we found when using it in production apps. This was truly a community effort and I would like to thanks everyone that was involved as well as Expo for sponsoring a large part of the development. It is now used by `Touchable` components in React Native as well as for navigation animations in the newly released [React Navigation](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation) library.

How does it work?[​](#how-does-it-work "Direct link to How does it work?")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, let's check out how animations currently work using Animated with the JS driver. When using Animated, you declare a graph of nodes that represent the animations that you want to perform, and then use a driver to update an Animated value using a predefined curve. You may also update an Animated value by connecting it to an event of a `View` using `Animated.event`.

![](/assets/images/animated-diagram-127161e299f43a8c0e677715d6be7881.png)

Here's a breakdown of the steps for an animation and where it happens:

* JS: The animation driver uses `requestAnimationFrame` to execute on every frame and update the value it drives using the new value it calculates based on the animation curve.
* JS: Intermediate values are calculated and passed to a props node that is attached to a `View`.
* JS: The `View` is updated using `setNativeProps`.
* JS to Native bridge.
* Native: The `UIView` or `android.View` is updated.

As you can see, most of the work happens on the JS thread. If it is blocked the animation will skip frames. It also needs to go through the JS to Native bridge on every frame to update native views.

What the native driver does is move all of these steps to native. Since Animated produces a graph of animated nodes, it can be serialized and sent to native only once when the animation starts, eliminating the need to callback into the JS thread; the native code can take care of updating the views directly on the UI thread on every frame.

Here's an example of how we can serialize an animated value and an interpolation node (not the exact implementation, just an example).

Create the native value node, this is the value that will be animated:

```
NativeAnimatedModule.createNode({  
  id: 1,  
  type: 'value',  
  initialValue: 0,  
});  

```

Create the native interpolation node, this tells the native driver how to interpolate a value:

```
NativeAnimatedModule.createNode({  
  id: 2,  
  type: 'interpolation',  
  inputRange: [0, 10],  
  outputRange: [10, 0],  
  extrapolate: 'clamp',  
});  

```

Create the native props node, this tells the native driver which prop on the view it is attached to:

```
NativeAnimatedModule.createNode({  
  id: 3,  
  type: 'props',  
  properties: ['style.opacity'],  
});  

```

Connect nodes together:

```
NativeAnimatedModule.connectNodes(1, 2);  
NativeAnimatedModule.connectNodes(2, 3);  

```

Connect the props node to a view:

```
NativeAnimatedModule.connectToView(3, ReactNative.findNodeHandle(viewRef));  

```

With that, the native animated module has all the info it needs to update the native views directly without having to go to JS to calculate any value.

All there is left to do is actually start the animation by specifying what type of animation curve we want and what animated value to update. Timing animations can also be simplified by calculating every frame of the animation in advance in JS to make the native implementation smaller.

```
NativeAnimatedModule.startAnimation({  
  type: 'timing',  
  frames: [0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.65, ...],  
  animatedValueId: 1,  
});  

```

And now here's the breakdown of what happens when the animation runs:

* Native: The native animation driver uses `CADisplayLink` or `android.view.Choreographer` to execute on every frame and update the value it drives using the new value it calculates based on the animation curve.
* Native: Intermediate values are calculated and passed to a props node that is attached to a native view.
* Native: The `UIView` or `android.View` is updated.

As you can see, no more JS thread and no more bridge which means faster animations! 🎉🎉

How do I use this in my app?[​](#how-do-i-use-this-in-my-app "Direct link to How do I use this in my app?")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For normal animations the answer is simple, just add `useNativeDriver: true` to the animation config when starting it.

Before:

```
Animated.timing(this.state.animatedValue, {  
  toValue: 1,  
  duration: 500,  
}).start();  

```

After:

```
Animated.timing(this.state.animatedValue, {  
  toValue: 1,  
  duration: 500,  
  useNativeDriver: true, // <-- Add this  
}).start();  

```

Animated values are only compatible with one driver so if you use native driver when starting an animation on a value, make sure every animation on that value also uses the native driver.

It also works with `Animated.event`, this is very useful if you have an animation that must follow the scroll position because without the native driver it will always run a frame behind of the gesture because of the async nature of React Native.

Before:

```
<ScrollView  
  scrollEventThrottle={16}  
  onScroll={Animated.event(  
    [{ nativeEvent: { contentOffset: { y: this.state.animatedValue } } }]  
  )}  
>  
  {content}  
</ScrollView>  

```

After:

```
<Animated.ScrollView // <-- Use the Animated ScrollView wrapper  
  scrollEventThrottle={1} // <-- Use 1 here to make sure no events are ever missed  
  onScroll={Animated.event(  
    [{ nativeEvent: { contentOffset: { y: this.state.animatedValue } } }],  
    { useNativeDriver: true } // <-- Add this  
  )}  
>  
  {content}  
</Animated.ScrollView>  

```

Caveats[​](#caveats "Direct link to Caveats")
---------------------------------------------

Not everything you can do with Animated is currently supported in Native Animated. The main limitation is that you can only animate non-layout properties, things like `transform` and `opacity` will work but Flexbox and position properties won't. Another one is with `Animated.event`, it will only work with direct events and not bubbling events. This means it does not work with `PanResponder` but does work with things like `ScrollView#onScroll`.

Native Animated has also been part of React Native for quite a while but has never been documented because it was considered experimental. Because of that make sure you are using a recent version (0.40+) of React Native if you want to use this feature.

[Right-to-Left Layout Support For React Native Apps](/blog/2016/08/19/right-to-left-support-for-react-native-apps)

After launching an app to the app stores, internationalization is the next step to further your audience reach. Over 20 countries and numerous people around the world use Right-to-Left (RTL) languages. Thus, making your app support RTL for them is necessary.

We're glad to announce that React Native has been improved to support RTL layouts. This is now available in the [react-native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) master branch today, and will be available in the next RC: [`v0.33.0-rc`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases).

This involved changing [css-layout](https://github.com/facebook/css-layout), the core layout engine used by RN, and RN core implementation, as well as specific OSS JS components to support RTL.

To battle test the RTL support in production, the latest version of the **Facebook Ads Manager** app (the first cross-platform 100% RN app) is now available in Arabic and Hebrew with RTL layouts for both [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id964397083) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.adsmanager). Here is how it looks like in those RTL languages:

![](/blog/assets/rtl-ama-ios-arabic.png)![](/blog/assets/rtl-ama-android-hebrew.png)

Overview Changes in RN for RTL support[​](#overview-changes-in-rn-for-rtl-support "Direct link to Overview Changes in RN for RTL support")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[css-layout](https://github.com/facebook/css-layout) already has a concept of `start` and `end` for the layout. In the Left-to-Right (LTR) layout, `start` means `left`, and `end` means `right`. But in RTL, `start` means `right`, and `end` means `left`. This means we can make RN depend on the `start` and `end` calculation to compute the correct layout, which includes `position`, `padding`, and `margin`.

In addition, [css-layout](https://github.com/facebook/css-layout) already makes each component's direction inherits from its parent. This means, we simply need to set the direction of the root component to RTL, and the entire app will flip.

The diagram below describes the changes at high level:

![](/assets/images/rtl-rn-core-updates-a7f3c54c3cd829c53a6da1d69bb8bf3c.png)

These include:

* [css-layout RTL support for absolute positioning](https://github.com/facebook/css-layout/commit/46c842c71a1232c3c78c4215275d104a389a9a0f)
* mapping `left` and `right` to `start` and `end` in RN core implementation for shadow nodes
* and exposing a [bridged utility module](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/f0fb228ec76ed49e6ed6d786d888e8113b8959a2/Libraries/Utilities/I18nManager.js) to help control the RTL layout

With this update, when you allow RTL layout for your app:

* every component layout will flip horizontally
* some gestures and animations will automatically have RTL layout, if you are using RTL-ready OSS components
* minimal additional effort may be needed to make your app fully RTL-ready

Making an App RTL-ready[​](#making-an-app-rtl-ready "Direct link to Making an App RTL-ready")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. To support RTL, you should first add the RTL language bundles to your app.

   * See the general guides from [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPInternational/LocalizingYourApp/LocalizingYourApp.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000171i-CH5-SW1) and [Android](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/supporting-devices/languages.html).
2. Allow RTL layout for your app by calling the `allowRTL()` function at the beginning of native code. We provided this utility to only apply to an RTL layout when your app is ready. Here is an example:

   iOS:

   ```
   // in AppDelegate.m  
     [[RCTI18nUtil sharedInstance] allowRTL:YES];  

   ```

   Android:

   ```
   // in MainActivity.java  
     I18nUtil sharedI18nUtilInstance = I18nUtil.getInstance();  
     sharedI18nUtilInstance.allowRTL(context, true);  

   ```
3. For Android, you need add `android:supportsRtl="true"` to the [`<application>`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html) element in `AndroidManifest.xml` file.

Now, when you recompile your app and change the device language to an RTL language (e.g. Arabic or Hebrew), your app layout should change to RTL automatically.

Writing RTL-ready Components[​](#writing-rtl-ready-components "Direct link to Writing RTL-ready Components")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In general, most components are already RTL-ready, for example:

* Left-to-Right Layout

![](/blog/assets/rtl-demo-listitem-ltr.png)

* Right-to-Left Layout

![](/blog/assets/rtl-demo-listitem-rtl.png)

However, there are several cases to be aware of, for which you will need the [`I18nManager`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/f0fb228ec76ed49e6ed6d786d888e8113b8959a2/Libraries/Utilities/I18nManager.js). In [`I18nManager`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/f0fb228ec76ed49e6ed6d786d888e8113b8959a2/Libraries/Utilities/I18nManager.js), there is a constant `isRTL` to tell if layout of app is RTL or not, so that you can make the necessary changes according to the layout.

#### Icons with Directional Meaning[​](#icons-with-directional-meaning "Direct link to Icons with Directional Meaning")

If your component has icons or images, they will be displayed the same way in LTR and RTL layout, because RN will not flip your source image. Therefore, you should flip them according to the layout style.

* Left-to-Right Layout

![](/blog/assets/rtl-demo-icon-ltr.png)

* Right-to-Left Layout

![](/blog/assets/rtl-demo-icon-rtl.png)

Here are two ways to flip the icon according to the direction:

* Adding a `transform` style to the image component:

  ```
  <Image  
    source={...}  
    style={{transform: [{scaleX: I18nManager.isRTL ? -1 : 1}]}}  
  />  

  ```
* Or, changing the image source according to the direction:

  ```
  let imageSource = require('./back.png');  
  if (I18nManager.isRTL) {  
    imageSource = require('./forward.png');  
  }  
  return <Image source={imageSource} />;  

  ```

#### Gestures and Animations[​](#gestures-and-animations "Direct link to Gestures and Animations")

In Android and iOS development, when you change to RTL layout, the gestures and animations are the opposite of LTR layout. Currently, in RN, gestures and animations are not supported on RN core code level, but on components level. The good news is, some of these components already support RTL today, such as [`SwipeableRow`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/38a6eec0db85a5204e85a9a92b4dee2db9641671/Libraries/Experimental/SwipeableRow/SwipeableRow.js) and [`NavigationExperimental`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/tree/master/Libraries/NavigationExperimental). However, other components with gestures will need to support RTL manually.

A good example to illustrate gesture RTL support is [`SwipeableRow`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/38a6eec0db85a5204e85a9a92b4dee2db9641671/Libraries/Experimental/SwipeableRow/SwipeableRow.js).

![](/blog/assets/rtl-demo-swipe-ltr.png)![](/blog/assets/rtl-demo-swipe-rtl.png)

##### Gestures Example[​](#gestures-example "Direct link to Gestures Example")

```
// SwipeableRow.js  
_isSwipingExcessivelyRightFromClosedPosition(gestureState: Object): boolean {  
  // ...  
  const gestureStateDx = IS_RTL ? -gestureState.dx : gestureState.dx;  
  return (  
    this._isSwipingRightFromClosed(gestureState) &&  
    gestureStateDx > RIGHT_SWIPE_THRESHOLD  
  );  
},  

```

##### Animation Example[​](#animation-example "Direct link to Animation Example")

```
// SwipeableRow.js  
_animateBounceBack(duration: number): void {  
  // ...  
  const swipeBounceBackDistance = IS_RTL ?  
    -RIGHT_SWIPE_BOUNCE_BACK_DISTANCE :  
    RIGHT_SWIPE_BOUNCE_BACK_DISTANCE;  
  this._animateTo(  
    -swipeBounceBackDistance,  
    duration,  
    this._animateToClosedPositionDuringBounce,  
  );  
},  

```

Maintaining Your RTL-ready App[​](#maintaining-your-rtl-ready-app "Direct link to Maintaining Your RTL-ready App")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Even after the initial RTL-compatible app release, you will likely need to iterate on new features. To improve development efficiency, [`I18nManager`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/f0fb228ec76ed49e6ed6d786d888e8113b8959a2/Libraries/Utilities/I18nManager.js) provides the `forceRTL()` function for faster RTL testing without changing the test device language. You might want to provide a simple switch for this in your app. Here's an example from the RTL example in the RNTester:

![](/blog/assets/rtl-demo-forcertl.png)

```
<RNTesterBlock title={'Quickly Test RTL Layout'}>  
  <View style={styles.flexDirectionRow}>  
    <Text style={styles.switchRowTextView}>forceRTL</Text>  
    <View style={styles.switchRowSwitchView}>  
      <Switch  
        onValueChange={this._onDirectionChange}  
        style={styles.rightAlignStyle}  
        value={this.state.isRTL}  
      />  
    </View>  
  </View>  
</RNTesterBlock>;  
  
_onDirectionChange = () => {  
  I18nManager.forceRTL(!this.state.isRTL);  
  this.setState({isRTL: !this.state.isRTL});  
  Alert.alert(  
    'Reload this page',  
    'Please reload this page to change the UI direction! ' +  
      'All examples in this app will be affected. ' +  
      'Check them out to see what they look like in RTL layout.',  
  );  
};  

```

When working on a new feature, you can easily toggle this button and reload the app to see RTL layout. The benefit is you won't need to change the language setting to test, however some text alignment won't change, as explained in the next section. Therefore, it's always a good idea to test your app in the RTL language before launching.

Limitations and Future Plan[​](#limitations-and-future-plan "Direct link to Limitations and Future Plan")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The RTL support should cover most of the UX in your app; however, there are some limitations for now:

* Text alignment behaviors differ in Android and iOS
  + In iOS, the default text alignment depends on the active language bundle, they are consistently on one side. In Android, the default text alignment depends on the language of the text content, i.e. English will be left-aligned and Arabic will be right-aligned.
  + In theory, this should be made consistent across platform, but some people may prefer one behavior to another when using an app. More user experience research may be needed to find out the best practice for text alignment.

* There is no "true" left/right

  As discussed before, we map the `left`/`right` styles from the JS side to `start`/`end`, all `left` in code for RTL layout becomes "right" on screen, and `right` in code becomes "left" on screen. This is convenient because you don't need to change your product code too much, but it means there is no way to specify "true left" or "true right" in the code. In the future, allowing a component to control its direction regardless of the language may be necessary.
* Make RTL support for gestures and animations more developer friendly

  Currently, there is still some programming effort required to make gestures and animations RTL compatible. In the future, it would be ideal to find a way to make gestures and animations RTL support more developer friendly.

Try it Out![​](#try-it-out "Direct link to Try it Out!")
--------------------------------------------------------

Check out the [`RTLExample`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/packages/rn-tester/js/examples/RTL/RTLExample.js) in the `RNTester` to understand more about RTL support, and let us know how it works for you!

Finally, thank you for reading! We hope that the RTL support for React Native helps you grow your apps for international audience!

React Native allows you to build Android and iOS apps in JavaScript using React and Relay's declarative programming model. This leads to more concise, easier-to-understand code; fast iteration without a compile cycle; and easy sharing of code across multiple platforms. You can ship faster and focus on details that really matter, making your app look and feel fantastic. Optimizing performance is a big part of this. Here is the story of how we made React Native app startup twice as fast.

Why the hurry?[​](#why-the-hurry "Direct link to Why the hurry?")
-----------------------------------------------------------------

With an app that runs faster, content loads quickly, which means people get more time to interact with it, and smooth animations make the app enjoyable to use. In emerging markets, where [2011 class phones](https://code.facebook.com/posts/952628711437136/classes-performance-and-network-segmentation-on-android/) on [2G networks](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/10/news-feed-fyi-building-for-all-connectivity/) are the majority, a focus on performance can make the difference between an app that is usable and one that isn't.

Since releasing React Native on [iOS](https://reactjs.org/blog/2015/03/26/introducing-react-native.html) and on [Android](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1189117404435352/react-native-for-android-how-we-built-the-first-cross-platform-react-native-app/), we have been improving list view scrolling performance, memory efficiency, UI responsiveness, and app startup time. Startup sets the first impression of an app and stresses all parts of the framework, so it is the most rewarding and challenging problem to tackle.

[Introducing Hot Reloading](/blog/2016/03/24/introducing-hot-reloading)

React Native's goal is to give you the best possible developer experience. A big part of it is the time it takes between you save a file and be able to see the changes. Our goal is to get this feedback loop to be under 1 second, even as your app grows.

We got close to this ideal via three main features:

* Use JavaScript as the language doesn't have a long compilation cycle time.
* Implement a tool called Packager that transforms es6/flow/jsx files into normal JavaScript that the VM can understand. It was designed as a server that keeps intermediate state in memory to enable fast incremental changes and uses multiple cores.
* Build a feature called Live Reload that reloads the app on save.

At this point, the bottleneck for developers is no longer the time it takes to reload the app but losing the state of your app. A common scenario is to work on a feature that is multiple screens away from the launch screen. Every time you reload, you've got to click on the same path again and again to get back to your feature, making the cycle multiple-seconds long.

Hot Reloading[​](#hot-reloading "Direct link to Hot Reloading")
---------------------------------------------------------------

The idea behind hot reloading is to keep the app running and to inject new versions of the files that you edited at runtime. This way, you don't lose any of your state which is especially useful if you are tweaking the UI.

A video is worth a thousand words. Check out the difference between Live Reload (current) and Hot Reload (new).

If you look closely, you can notice that it is possible to recover from a red box and you can also start importing modules that were not previously there without having to do a full reload.

**Word of warning:** because JavaScript is a very stateful language, hot reloading cannot be perfectly implemented. In practice, we found out that the current setup is working well for a large amount of usual use cases and a full reload is always available in case something gets messed up.

Hot reloading is available as of 0.22, you can enable it:

* Open the developer menu
* Tap on "Enable Hot Reloading"

Implementation in a nutshell[​](#implementation-in-a-nutshell "Direct link to Implementation in a nutshell")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that we've seen why we want it and how to use it, the fun part begins: how it actually works.

Hot Reloading is built on top of a feature [Hot Module Replacement](https://webpack.js.org/guides/hot-module-replacement/), or HMR. It was first introduced by webpack and we implemented it inside of React Native Packager. HMR makes the Packager watch for file changes and send HMR updates to a thin HMR runtime included on the app.

In a nutshell, the HMR update contains the new code of the JS modules that changed. When the runtime receives them, it replaces the old modules' code with the new one:

![](/assets/images/hmr-architecture-fc0ad839836fbf08ce9b0557be33c5ad.png)

The HMR update contains a bit more than just the module's code we want to change because replacing it, it's not enough for the runtime to pick up the changes. The problem is that the module system may have already cached the *exports* of the module we want to update. For instance, say you have an app composed of these two modules:

```
// log.js  
function log(message) {  
  const time = require('./time');  
  console.log(`[${time()}] ${message}`);  
}  
  
module.exports = log;  

```

```
// time.js  
function time() {  
  return new Date().getTime();  
}  
  
module.exports = time;  

```

The module `log`, prints out the provided message including the current date provided by the module `time`.

When the app is bundled, React Native registers each module on the module system using the `__d` function. For this app, among many `__d` definitions, there will one for `log`:

```
__d('log', function() {  
  ... // module's code  
});  

```

This invocation wraps each module's code into an anonymous function which we generally refer to as the factory function. The module system runtime keeps track of each module's factory function, whether it has already been executed, and the result of such execution (exports). When a module is required, the module system either provides the already cached exports or executes the module's factory function for the first time and saves the result.

So say you start your app and require `log`. At this point, neither `log` nor `time`'s factory functions have been executed so no exports have been cached. Then, the user modifies `time` to return the date in `MM/DD`:

```
// time.js  
function bar() {  
  const date = new Date();  
  return `${date.getMonth() + 1}/${date.getDate()}`;  
}  
  
module.exports = bar;  

```

The Packager will send time's new code to the runtime (step 1), and when `log` gets eventually required the exported function gets executed it will do so with `time`'s changes (step 2):

![](/assets/images/hmr-step-9d2dd4297f792827ffabc55bb1154b8a.png)

Now say the code of `log` requires `time` as a top level require:

```
const time = require('./time'); // top level require  
  
// log.js  
function log(message) {  
  console.log(`[${time()}] ${message}`);  
}  
  
module.exports = log;  

```

When `log` is required, the runtime will cache its exports and `time`'s one. (step 1). Then, when `time` is modified, the HMR process cannot simply finish after replacing `time`'s code. If it did, when `log` gets executed, it would do so with a cached copy of `time` (old code).

For `log` to pick up `time` changes, we'll need to clear its cached exports because one of the modules it depends on was hot swapped (step 3). Finally, when `log` gets required again, its factory function will get executed requiring `time` and getting its new code.

![](/assets/images/hmr-log-884dbcc7b040993d7d402bba105c537e.png)

HMR API[​](#hmr-api "Direct link to HMR API")
---------------------------------------------

HMR in React Native extends the module system by introducing the `hot` object. This API is based on [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/hot-module-replacement.md)'s one. The `hot` object exposes a function called `accept` which allows you to define a callback that will be executed when the module needs to be hot swapped. For instance, if we would change `time`'s code as follows, every time we save time, we'll see “time changed” in the console:

```
// time.js  
function time() {  
  ... // new code  
}  
  
module.hot.accept(() => {  
  console.log('time changed');  
});  
  
module.exports = time;  

```

Note that only in rare cases you would need to use this API manually. Hot Reloading should work out of the box for the most common use cases.

HMR Runtime[​](#hmr-runtime "Direct link to HMR Runtime")
---------------------------------------------------------

As we've seen before, sometimes it's not enough only accepting the HMR update because a module that uses the one being hot swapped may have been already executed and its imports cached. For instance, suppose the dependency tree for the movies app example had a top-level `MovieRouter` that depended on the `MovieSearch` and `MovieScreen` views, which depended on the `log` and `time` modules from the previous examples:

![](/assets/images/hmr-diamond-55c39ddebd4758c5434b39890281f69e.png)

If the user accesses the movies' search view but not the other one, all the modules except for `MovieScreen` would have cached exports. If a change is made to module `time`, the runtime will have to clear the exports of `log` for it to pick up `time`'s changes. The process wouldn't finish there: the runtime will repeat this process recursively up until all the parents have been accepted. So, it'll grab the modules that depend on `log` and try to accept them. For `MovieScreen` it can bail, as it hasn't been required yet. For `MovieSearch`, it will have to clear its exports and process its parents recursively. Finally, it will do the same thing for `MovieRouter` and finish there as no modules depends on it.

In order to walk the dependency tree, the runtime receives the inverse dependency tree from the Packager on the HMR update. For this example the runtime will receive a JSON object like this one:

```
{  
  modules: [  
    {  
      name: 'time',  
      code: /* time's new code */  
    }  
  ],  
  inverseDependencies: {  
    MovieRouter: [],  
    MovieScreen: ['MovieRouter'],  
    MovieSearch: ['MovieRouter'],  
    log: ['MovieScreen', 'MovieSearch'],  
    time: ['log'],  
  }  
}  

```

React Components[​](#react-components "Direct link to React Components")
------------------------------------------------------------------------

React components are a bit harder to get to work with Hot Reloading. The problem is that we can't simply replace the old code with the new one as we'd loose the component's state. For React web applications, [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) implemented a babel [transform](https://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/) that uses webpack's HMR API to solve this issue. In a nutshell, his solution works by creating a proxy for every single React component on *transform time*. The proxies hold the component's state and delegate the lifecycle methods to the actual components, which are the ones we hot reload:

Besides creating the proxy component, the transform also defines the `accept` function with a piece of code to force React to re-render the component. This way, we can hot reload rendering code without losing any of the app's state.

The default [transformer](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/packager/transformer.js#L92-L95) that comes with React Native uses the `babel-preset-react-native`, which is [configured](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/babel-preset/configs/hmr.js#L24-L31) to use `react-transform` the same way you'd use it on a React web project that uses webpack.

Redux Stores[​](#redux-stores "Direct link to Redux Stores")
------------------------------------------------------------

To enable Hot Reloading on [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) stores you will just need to use the HMR API similarly to what you'd do on a web project that uses webpack:

```
// configureStore.js  
import { createStore, applyMiddleware, compose } from 'redux';  
import thunk from 'redux-thunk';  
import reducer from '../reducers';  
  
export default function configureStore(initialState) {  
  const store = createStore(  
    reducer,  
    initialState,  
    applyMiddleware(thunk),  
  );  
  
  if (module.hot) {  
    module.hot.accept(() => {  
      const nextRootReducer = require('../reducers/index').default;  
      store.replaceReducer(nextRootReducer);  
    });  
  }  
  
  return store;  
};  

```

When you change a reducer, the code to accept that reducer will be sent to the client. Then the client will realize that the reducer doesn't know how to accept itself, so it will look for all the modules that refer it and try to accept them. Eventually, the flow will get to the single store, the `configureStore` module, which will accept the HMR update.

Conclusion[​](#conclusion "Direct link to Conclusion")
------------------------------------------------------

If you are interested in helping making hot reloading better, I encourage you to read [Dan Abramov's post around the future of hot reloading](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/hot-reloading-in-react-1140438583bf#.jmivpvmz4) and to contribute. For example, Johny Days is going to [make it work with multiple connected clients](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/6179). We're relying on you all to maintain and improve this feature.

With React Native, we have the opportunity to rethink the way we build apps in order to make it a great developer experience. Hot reloading is only one piece of the puzzle, what other crazy hacks can we do to make it better?

One key aspect of building a robust product is ensuring that anyone can use it, including people who have vision loss or other disabilities. The Accessibility API for React and React Native enables you to make any React-powered experience usable by someone who may use assistive technology, like a screen reader for the blind and visually impaired.

For this post, we're going to focus on React Native apps. We've designed the React Accessibility API to look and feel similar to the Android and iOS APIs. If you've developed accessible applications for Android, iOS, or the web before, you should feel comfortable with the framework and nomenclature of the React AX API. For instance, you can make a UI element *accessible* (therefore exposed to assistive technology) and use *accessibilityLabel* to provide a string description for the element:

```
<View accessible={true} accessibilityLabel=”This is simple view”>  

```

Let's walk through a slightly more involved application of the React AX API by looking at one of Facebook's own React-powered products: the **Ads Manager app**.
