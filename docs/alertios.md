ðŸš§ AlertIOS
==========

> **Removed.** Use [`Alert`](/docs/alert) instead.

`AlertIOS` provides functionality to create an iOS alert dialog with a message or create a prompt for user input.

Creating an iOS alert:

jsx

```
AlertIOS.alert(  
  'Sync Complete',  
  'All your data are belong to us.',  
);  

```

Creating an iOS prompt:

jsx

```
AlertIOS.prompt('Enter a value', null, text =>  
  console.log('You entered ' + text),  
);  

```

We recommend using the [`Alert.alert`](/docs/alert) method for cross-platform support if you don't need to create iOS-only prompts.
