Ignore files via .easignore
===========================

[Edit this page](https://github.com/expo/expo/edit/main/docs/pages/build-reference/easignore.mdx)

Learn how to configure EAS to ignore unnecessary files during the build process.

[Edit this page](https://github.com/expo/expo/edit/main/docs/pages/build-reference/easignore.mdx)

---

A .easignore file defines which files [EAS](https://expo.dev/eas) should ignore when uploading your project to the [EAS Build](/build/introduction) servers.

> Ignoring unnecessary files can help reduce your app's archive size and upload time.

By default, the [EAS CLI](/build/setup#install-the-latest-eas-cli) refers to the [.gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) file (if it exists) to determine which files to ignore. If you create a .easignore file, the EAS CLI prioritizes it over the .gitignore file. When creating a .easignore file, include all files and directories from your .gitignore file and add additional files you want to ignore.

1

Create a .easignore file in the root of your project.

2

Copy the content of the .gitignore file into the .easignore file. Then, add any files that are unnecessary for the build process.

.easignore

Copy

```
# Copy everything from your .gitignore file here

# Ignore files and directories that EAS Build doesn't need to build your app
/docs

# Ignore native directories (if you are using EAS Build)
/android
/ios

# Ignore test coverage reports
/coverage

```

If your project does not contain android and ios directories, [EAS Build will run Prebuild](/workflow/prebuild#usage-with-eas-build) to generate these native directories before compilation.

3

Save the file and trigger a new build.

Terminal

Copy

`-Ã‚``eas build --platform ios --profile development`

You've successfully configured your .easignore file.

Adding files to your project upload with .easignore
---------------------------------------------------

In addition to ignoring additional files beyond what is in your gitignore file, you can also use the .easignore file to include files with your EAS Build upload that are not committed to source control. This is useful if you have custom scripts that generate temporary files needed for your build process just before the build. To upload a file not in source control to EAS Build, add it to the .easignore file with a `!` prefix, along with the rest of your .gitignore contents. The `!` prefixed file should be last, so it takes precedence over any prior rules that would ignore it.

.easignore

Copy

```
# Copy everything from your .gitignore file here

/android
/ios

# Include a file not in source control
!temp_file.json

```
