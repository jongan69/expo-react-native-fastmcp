Learn how to create a new Expo project.

[Edit this page](https://github.com/expo/expo/edit/main/docs/pages/get-started/create-a-project.mdx)

---

System requirements:

* [Node.js (LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/).
* macOS, Windows (Powershell and [WSL 2](https://expo.fyi/wsl)), and Linux are supported.

We recommend starting with the default project created by `create-expo-app`. The default project includes example code to help you get started.

To create a new project, run the following command:

Terminal

Copy

`-Ã‚``npx create-expo-app@latest`

> You can choose a different template by adding the [`--template` option](/more/create-expo#--template).

Next step
---------

You have a project. Now it's time to set up your development environment so that you can start developing.
