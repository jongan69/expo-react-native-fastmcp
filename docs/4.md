[Announcing React Native 0.63 with LogBox](/blog/2020/07/06/version-0.63)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

July 6, 2020 · 8 min read

Mike Grabowski

CTO and Co-Founder @ Callstack

Today we’re releasing React Native 0.63 that ships with LogBox turned on by default.

LogBox[​](#logbox "Direct link to LogBox")
------------------------------------------

We’ve heard frequent feedback from the community that errors and warnings are difficult to debug in React Native. To address these issues we took a look at the entire error, warning, and log system in React Native and redesigned it [from the ground up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8brBH5O-bQ&feature=youtu.be).

![Screenshot of LogBox](/assets/images/0.63-logbox-a209851328e548bf0810bdee050fb960.png)

LogBox is a completely redesigned redbox, yellowbox, and logging experience in React Native. In 0.62 we introduced LogBox as an opt-in. In this release, we’re launching LogBox as the default experience in all of React Native.

LogBox addresses complaints that errors and warnings were too verbose, poorly formatted, or unactionable by focusing on three primary goals:

* **Concise**: Logs should provide the minimum amount of information necessary to debug an issue.
* **Formatted**: Logs should be formatted so that you can quickly find the information you need.
* **Actionable**: Logs should be actionable, so you can fix the issue and move on.

To achieve these goals, LogBox includes:

* **Log notifications**: We’ve redesigned the warning notifications and added support for errors so that all console.warn and console.log messages show up as notifications instead of covering your app.
* **Code Frames**: Every error and warning now includes a code frame that shows the source code of the log right inside the app, allowing you to quickly identify the source of your issue.
* **Component Stacks**: All component stacks are now stripped from error messages and put into their own section with the top three frames visible. This gives you a single, consistent space to expect stack frame information that doesn’t clutter the log message.
* **Stack Frame Collapsing**: By default we now collapse call stack frames not related to your application’s code so you can quickly see the issue in your app and not sift through React Native internals.
* **Syntax Error Formatting**: We’ve improved the formatting for syntax errors and added codeframes with syntax highlighting so you can see the source of the error, fix it, and continue coding without React Native getting in your way.

We’ve wrapped all of these features into an improved visual design that’s consistent between errors and warnings and allows paginating through all logs in one enjoyable UI.

With this change we’re also deprecating YellowBox in favor of LogBox APIs:

* `LogBox.ignoreLogs()`: This function replaces `YellowBox.ignoreLogs([])` as a way to silence any logs that match the given strings or regexes.
* `LogBox.ignoreAllLogs()`: This function replaces `console.disableYellowBox` as a way to turn off error or warning notifications. Note: this only disables notifications, uncaught errors will still open a full screen LogBox.

In 0.63, we will warn when using these deprecated modules or methods. Please update your call sites off of these APIs before they are removed in 0.64.

For more information on LogBox and debugging react native, see the docs [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/debugging#in-app-errors-and-warnings).

Pressable[​](#pressable "Direct link to Pressable")
---------------------------------------------------

React Native is built to enable applications to meet user’s expectations of the platform. This includes avoiding “tells”—little things that give away that the experience was built with React Native. One major source of these tells has been the Touchable components: `Button`, `TouchableWithoutFeedback`, `TouchableHighlight`, `TouchableOpacity`, `TouchableNativeFeedback`, and `TouchableBounce`. These components make your application interactive by allowing you to provide visual feedback to user interactions. However, because they include built-in styles and effects that don’t match the platform interaction, users can tell when experiences are written with React Native.

Further, as React Native has grown and our bar for high-quality applications has gone up, these components haven't grown with it. React Native now supports platforms like Web, Desktop, and TV, but support for additional input modalities has been lacking. React Native needs to support high-quality interaction experiences on all platforms.

To address these problems, we are shipping a new core component called `Pressable`. This component can be used to detect various types of interactions. The API was designed to provide direct access to the current state of interaction without having to maintain state manually in a parent component. It was also designed to enable platforms to extend it's capabilities to include hover, blur, focus, and more. We expect that most people will build and share components utilizing `Pressable` under the hood instead of relying on the default experience of something like `TouchableOpacity`.

```
import {Pressable, Text} from 'react-native';  
  
<Pressable  
  onPress={() => {  
    console.log('pressed');  
  }}  
  style={({pressed}) => ({  
    backgroundColor: pressed ? 'lightskyblue' : 'white',  
  })}>  
  <Text style={styles.text}>Press Me!</Text>  
</Pressable>;  

```

A simple example of a Pressable component in action

You can learn more about it from [the documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/pressable).

Native Colors (PlatformColor, DynamicColorIOS)[​](#native-colors-platformcolor-dynamiccolorios "Direct link to Native Colors (PlatformColor, DynamicColorIOS)")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every native platform has the concept of system-defined colors. Colors that automatically respond to system theme settings such as Light or Dark mode, accessibility settings such as a High Contrast mode, and even its context within the app such as the traits of a containing view or window.

While it is possible to detect some of these settings via the [`Appearance`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/appearance#getcolorscheme) API and/or [`AccessibilityInfo`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibilityinfo#isgrayscaleenabled) and set your styles accordingly, such abstractions are not only costly to develop but are approximating the appearance of native colors. These inconsistencies are particularly noticeable when working on a hybrid application, where React Native elements co-exist next to the native ones.

React Native now provides an out-of-the-box solution to use these system colors. `PlatformColor()` is a new API that can be used like any other color in React Native.

For example, on iOS, the [system provides a color called `labelColor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicolor/ui_element_colors?language=objc). That can be used in React Native with `PlatformColor` like this:

```
import {Text, PlatformColor} from 'react-native';  
  
<Text style={{color: PlatformColor('labelColor')}}>  
  This is a label  
</Text>;  

```

Sets the color of the Text component to labelColor as defined by iOS.

Android, on the other hand, [provides colors like colorButtonNormal](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr#colorButtonNormal). You can use this color in React Native with:

```
import {View, Text, PlatformColor} from 'react-native';  
  
<View  
  style={{  
    backgroundColor: PlatformColor('?attr/colorButtonNormal'),  
  }}>  
  <Text>This is colored like a button!</Text>  
</View>;  

```

Sets the background color of the View component to colorButtonNormal as defined by Android.

You can learn more about `PlatformColor` from [the documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/platformcolor). You can also check the actual [code examples present in the RNTester](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/packages/rn-tester/js/examples/PlatformColor/PlatformColorExample.js).

`DynamicColorIOS` is an iOS only API that lets you define which color to use in light and dark mode. Similar to `PlatformColor`, this can be used anywhere you can use colors. `DynamicColorIOS` uses iOS’s `colorWithDynamicProvider` under the hood.

```
import {Text, DynamicColorIOS} from 'react-native';  
  
const customDynamicTextColor = DynamicColorIOS({  
  dark: 'lightskyblue',  
  light: 'midnightblue',  
});  
  
<Text style={{color: customDynamicTextColor}}>  
  This color changes automatically based on the system theme!  
</Text>;  

```

Changes the text color based on the system theme

You can learn more about `DynamicColorIOS` from [the documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/dynamiccolorios).

Dropping iOS 9 and Node.js 8 support[​](#dropping-ios-9-and-nodejs-8-support "Direct link to Dropping iOS 9 and Node.js 8 support")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After over four years from its release, we are dropping support for iOS 9. This change will allow us to move faster by being able to reduce the number of compatibility checks that need to be placed in the native code to detect whether a given feature was supported on a certain iOS version. With its [market share of 1%](https://david-smith.org/iosversionstats/), it shouldn’t have much negative impact on your customers.

At the same time, we are dropping support for Node 8. [Its LTS maintenance cycle expired in December 2019](https://nodejs.org/fr/blog/release/v8.9.0/). The current LTS is Node 10 and it is now the version that we are targeting. If you are still using Node 8 for the development of React Native applications, we encourage you to upgrade in order to receive all the latest security fixes and updates.

Other notable improvements[​](#other-notable-improvements "Direct link to Other notable improvements")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **Support rendering `<View />` in `<Text />` without explicit size**: You can now render any `<View />` inside any `<Text />` component without setting its width and height explicitly, which wasn’t always possible. On previous releases of React Native, this would result in a RedBox.
* **Changed iOS LaunchScreen from `xib` to `storyboard`**: Starting April 30, 2020, all apps submitted to the App Store must use an Xcode storyboard to provide the app’s launch screen and all iPhone apps must support all iPhone screens. This commit adjusts the default React Native template to be compatible with this requirement.

React Native Core at Facebook

Today we’re releasing React Native version 0.62 which includes support for Flipper by default.

This release comes in the midst of a global pandemic. We’re releasing this version today to respect the work of hundreds of contributors who made this release possible and to prevent the release from falling too far behind master. Please be mindful of the reduced capacity of contributors to help with issues and prepare to delay upgrading if necessary.

Flipper by default[​](#flipper-by-default "Direct link to Flipper by default")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Flipper](https://fbflipper.com/) is a developer tool for debugging mobile apps. It’s popular in the Android and iOS communities, and in this release we’ve enabled support by default for new and existing React Native apps.

![Screenshot of Flipper for React Native](/assets/images/0.62-flipper-dc5a5cb54cc6033750c56f3c147c6ce3.png)

Flipper provides the following features out of the box:

* **Metro Actions**: Reload the app and trigger the Dev Menu right from the toolbar.
* **Crash Reporter**: View crash reports from Android and iOS devices.
* **React DevTools**: Use the newest version of React DevTools right alongside all your other tools.
* **Network Inspector**: View all of the network requests made by device applications.
* **Metro and Device Logs**: View, search, and filter all logs from both Metro and the Device.
* **Native Layout Inspector**: View and edit the native layout output by the React Native renderer.
* **Database and Preference Inspectors**: View and edit the device databases and preferences.

Additionally, since Flipper is an extensible platform, it provides a marketplace that pulls plugins from NPM so you can publish and install custom plugins specific to your workflows. See the available plugins [here](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=flipper-plugin).

For more information, check out the [Flipper documentation](https://fbflipper.com/docs/features/react-native).

New dark mode features[​](#new-dark-mode-features "Direct link to New dark mode features")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We’ve added a new `Appearance` module to provide access to the user's appearance preferences, such as their preferred color scheme (light or dark).

```
const colorScheme = Appearance.getColorScheme();  
if (colorScheme === 'dark') {  
  // Use dark color scheme  
}  

```

We’ve also added a hook to subscribe to state updates to the users preferences:

```
import {Text, useColorScheme} from 'react-native';  
  
const MyComponent = () => {  
  const colorScheme = useColorScheme();  
  return <Text>useColorScheme(): {colorScheme}</Text>;  
};  

```

See the docs for [Appearance](/docs/appearance) and [useColorScheme](/docs/usecolorscheme) for more information.

Moving Apple TV to react-native-tvos[​](#moving-apple-tv-to-react-native-tvos "Direct link to Moving Apple TV to react-native-tvos")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As part of our [Lean Core effort](/blog#lean-core) and to bring Apple TV in line with other platforms like React Native Windows and React Native macOS, we’ve started to remove Apple TV specific code from core.

Going forward, Apple TV support for React Native will be maintained in [react-native-community/react-native-tvos](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-tvos) along with the corresponding `react-native-tvos` NPM package. This is a full fork of the main repository, with only the changes needed to support Apple TV.

Releases of `react-native-tvos` will be based on the public release of React Native. For this 0.62 release of `react-native` please upgrade Apple TV projects to use `react-native-tvos` 0.62.

More upgrade support[​](#more-upgrade-support "Direct link to More upgrade support")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When 0.61 was released, the community introduced a new [upgrade helper](https://react-native-community.github.io/upgrade-helper/) tool to support developers upgrading to new versions of React Native. The upgrade helper provides a diff of changes from the version you're on to the version you're targeting, allowing you to see the changes that need to be made for your specific upgrade.

Even with this tool, issues come up when upgrading. Today we're introducing more dedicated upgrading support by announcing [Upgrade-Support](https://github.com/react-native-community/upgrade-support). Upgrade Support is a GitHub issue tracker where users can submit issues specific to upgrading their projects to receive help from the community.

We're always working to improve the upgrade experience, and we hope that these tools give users the support they need in the edge cases we haven't covered yet.

Other improvements[​](#other-improvements "Direct link to Other improvements")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **LogBox**: We’re adding the new LogBox error and warning experience as an opt-in; to enable it, add `require('react-native').unstable_enableLogBox()` to your `index.js` file.
* **React DevTools v4**: This change includes an upgrade to the [latest React DevTools](https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/08/15/new-react-devtools.html) which offers significant performance gains, an improved navigation experience, and full support for React Hooks.
* **Accessibility improvements**: We’ve made improvements to accessibility including adding [accessibilityValue](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility#accessibilityvalue-ios-android), missing props on [Touchables](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/8c0c860e38f57e18296f689e47dfb4a54088c260), `onSlidingComplete` [accessibility events](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/c7aa6dc8270c0eabc913fe6c617c8131e3f4b3c5), and changing the default role of Switch component from `"button"` to `"switch"`.

Breaking changes[​](#breaking-changes "Direct link to Breaking changes")
------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **Remove PropTypes**: We're removing `propTypes` from core components in order to reduce the app size impact of React Native core and to favor static type systems which check at compile time instead of runtime.
* **Remove accessibilityStates**: We’ve [removed](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/7b35f427fd66cb0f36921b992095fe5b3c14d8b9) the deprecated `accessibilityStates` property in favor of the new `accessibilityState` prop which is a more semantically rich way for components to describe information about their state to accessibility services.
* **TextInput changes**: We removed `onTextInput` [from TextInput](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/3f7e0a2c9601fc186f25bfd794cd0008ac3983ab) as it’s uncommon, not W3C compliant, and difficult to implement in [Fabric](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/4). We also removed the undocumented `inputView` prop, and `selectionState`.

Deprecations[​](#deprecations "Direct link to Deprecations")
------------------------------------------------------------

* `AccessibilityInfo.fetch` was already deprecated, but in this release we [added a warning](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/523ab8333800afbfb169c6fd70ab6611fe07cc2a).
* Setting `useNativeDriver` is [now required](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/5876052615f4858ed5fc32fa3da9b64695974238) to support switching the default in the future.
* The `ref` of an `Animated` component is now the internal component and [deprecated](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/66e72bb4e00aafbcb9f450ed5db261d98f99f82a) `getNode`.

[Announcing React Native 0.61 with Fast Refresh](/blog/2019/09/18/version-0.61)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

React Core at Facebook

We’re excited to announce React Native 0.61, which includes a new reloading experience we’re calling Fast Refresh.

Fast Refresh[​](#fast-refresh "Direct link to Fast Refresh")
------------------------------------------------------------

When we asked the React Native community about [common pain points](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/64), one of the top answers was that the “hot reloading” feature was broken. It didn’t work reliably for function components, often failed to update the screen, and wasn’t resilient to typos and mistakes. We heard that most people turned it off because it was too unreliable.

In React Native 0.61, **we’re unifying the existing “live reloading” (reload on save) and “hot reloading” features into a single new feature called “Fast Refresh”**. Fast Refresh was implemented from scratch with the following principles:

* Fast Refresh **fully supports modern React**, including function components and Hooks.
* Fast Refresh **gracefully recovers after typos** and other mistakes, and falls back to a full reload when needed.
* Fast Refresh **doesn’t perform invasive code transformations** so it’s reliable enough to be on by default.

To see Fast Refresh in action, check out this video:

[](https://reactnative.dev/img/homepage/ReactRefresh.mp4)

Give it a try, and let us know what you think! If you prefer, you can turn it off in the Dev Menu (Cmd+D on iOS, Cmd+M or Ctrl+M on Android). Turning it on and off is instant so you can do it any time.

Here are a few Fast Refresh tips:

* Fast Refresh preserves React local state in function components (and Hooks!) by default.
* If you need to reset the React state on every edit, you can add a special `// @refresh reset` comment to the file with that component.
* Fast Refresh always remounts class components without preserving state. This ensures it works reliably.
* We all make mistakes in the code! Fast Refresh automatically retries rendering after you save a file. You don't need to reload the app manually after fixing a syntax or a runtime error.
* Adding a `console.log` or a `debugger` statement during edits is a neat debugging technique.

Please report any issues with Fast Refresh on GitHub, and we’ll look into them.

Other Improvements[​](#other-improvements "Direct link to Other Improvements")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **Fixed use\_frameworks! CocoaPods support.** In 0.60 we made some updates to integrate CocoaPods by default. Unfortunately, this broke builds using [use\_frameworks!](https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podfile.html#use_frameworks_bang). This is [fixed in 0.61](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/25619), making it easier to integrate React Native into your iOS projects that require building with dynamic frameworks.
* **Add useWindowDimensions Hook.** This new Hook automatically provides and subscribes to dimension updates, and can be used instead of the Dimensions API in most cases.
* **React was upgraded to 16.9.** This version deprecates old names for the UNSAFE\_ lifecycle methods, contains improvements to `act`, and more. See the [React 16.9 blog post](https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/08/08/react-v16.9.0.html) for an automated migration script and more information.

Breaking Changes[​](#breaking-changes "Direct link to Breaking Changes")
------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **Remove React .xcodeproj.** In 0.60, we introduced auto-linking support via CocoaPods. We have also integrated CocoaPods into the e2e tests runs, so that from now on, we have a unified standard way of integrating RN into iOS apps. This effectively deprecates the React .xcodeproj support, and the file has been removed starting 0.61. Note: if you use 0.60 auto-linking already, you shouldn't be affected.

Thanks[​](#thanks "Direct link to Thanks")
------------------------------------------

Thanks to all of the contributors that helped make 0.61 possible!

Last week at Chain React we announced Hermes, an open source JavaScript engine we’ve been working on at Facebook. It’s a small and lightweight JavaScript engine optimized for running React Native on Android. [Check it out!](https://code.fb.com/android/hermes/)

Hermes improves React Native performance by decreasing memory utilization, reducing download size, and decreasing the time it takes for the app to become usable or “time to interactive” (TTI).

> “As we analyzed performance data, we noticed that the JavaScript engine itself was a significant factor in startup performance and download size. With this data in hand, we knew we had to optimize JavaScript performance in the more constrained environments of a mobile phone compared with a desktop or laptop. After exploring other options, we built a new JavaScript engine we call Hermes. It is designed to improve app performance, focusing on our React Native apps, even on mass-market devices with limited memory, slow storage, and reduced computing power.” —[Hermes: An open source JavaScript engine optimized for mobile apps, starting with React Native](https://code.fb.com/android/hermes/)

Want to get started right away? Be sure to [check out our new guide to enabling Hermes in your existing React Native app](/docs/hermes) in the docs!

Core Maintainer & React Native Developer

After months of hard work from hundreds of contributors, the React Native Core team is proud to announce the release of version 0.60. This release handles significant migrations for both Android and iOS platforms, and many issues are resolved too. This blog post covers the highlights of the release. As always though, refer to the changelog for more detailed information. Finally, thank you contributors for helping us to make this milestone!

Focus on Accessibility[​](#focus-on-accessibility "Direct link to Focus on Accessibility")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There have been many improvements to the accessibility APIs, like [announceForAccessibility](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/cfe0032), plus improvements to [roles](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/1aeac1c), [action support](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/14b4668), [flags](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/0090ab3), and more. Accessibility is a complex science, but we hope these improvements make it a bit easier to be an A11Y. Be sure to check [React Native Open Source Update June 2019](/blog/2019/06/12/react-native-open-source-update#meaningful-community-contributions) for more details of these changes.

A Fresh Start[​](#a-fresh-start "Direct link to A Fresh Start")
---------------------------------------------------------------

React Native's start screen has been updated! Thank you to the many contributors who helped create the new UI. This new "Hello World" will welcome users to the ecosystem in a more friendly, engaging way.

![The new init screen helps developers get started from the get-go with resources and a good example](/assets/images/0.60-new-init-screen-5b31714cd0630d7df25c66cab80c210b.png)

AndroidX Support[​](#androidx-support "Direct link to AndroidX Support")
------------------------------------------------------------------------

[AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx) is a major step forward in the Android ecosystem, and the old support library artifacts are being deprecated. For 0.60, React Native has been migrated over to AndroidX. This is a breaking change, and **your native code and dependencies will need to be migrated** as well.

> With this change, React Native apps will need to begin using AndroidX themselves. They cannot be used side-by-side in one app, so all of the app code and dependency code needs to be using one or the other.
>
> [matt-oakes](https://github.com/matt-oakes) on [discussions-and-proposals](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/129)

While your own native code will need to be migrated by you, [@mikehardy](https://github.com/mikehardy), [@cawfree](https://github.com/cawfree), and [@m4tt72](https://github.com/m4tt72) built a [clever tool named "jetifier"](https://github.com/mikehardy/jetifier) to patch your `node_modules`. Library maintainers will need to upgrade, but this tool provide you with a temporary solution while giving them time to release an AndroidX version. So if you find errors related to AndroidX migration, give this a shot.

CocoaPods by Default[​](#cocoapods-by-default "Direct link to CocoaPods by Default")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[CocoaPods are now part of React Native's iOS project](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0004-cocoapods-support-improvements.md). If you weren't already, be sure to open iOS platform code using the `xcworkspace` file from now on (protip: try `xed ios` from the root project directory). Also, the `podspec`s for the internal packages have changed to make them compatible with the Xcode projects, which will help with troubleshooting and debugging. Expect to make [some straightforward changes](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/2321b3f) to your `Podfile` as part of the upgrade to 0.60 to bring this exciting support. Note that we are aware of a compatibility issue with `use_frameworks!`, and we're tracking an [issue](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/25349) with workarounds and a future patch.

Lean Core Removals[​](#lean-core-removals "Direct link to Lean Core Removals")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**WebView** and **NetInfo** were previously extracted into separate repositories, and in 0.60 we’ve finished migrating them out of the React Native repository. Additionally, in response to community feedback about new App Store policy, **Geolocation** has been extracted. If you haven’t already, complete your migration by adding dependencies to [react-native-webview](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview), [@react-native-community/netinfo](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-netinfo), and [@react-native-community/geolocation](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-geolocation). If you'd like an automated solution, consider using [rn-upgrade-deprecated-modules](https://github.com/lucasbento/rn-update-deprecated-modules). Maintainers have made more than 100 commits to these repositories since extraction and we’re excited to see the community’s support!

Native Modules are now Autolinked[​](#native-modules-are-now-autolinked "Direct link to Native Modules are now Autolinked")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The team working on the [React Native CLI](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli) has introduced major improvements to native module linking called [autolinking](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md)! Most scenarios will not require the use of `react-native link` anymore. At the same time, the team overhauled the linking process in general. Be sure to `react-native unlink` any preexisting dependencies as mentioned in the docs above.

Upgrade Helper[​](#upgrade-helper "Direct link to Upgrade Helper")
------------------------------------------------------------------

[@lucasbento](https://github.com/lucasbento), [@pvinis](https://github.com/pvinis), [@kelset](https://github.com/kelset), and [@watadarkstar](https://github.com/watadarkstar) have built a great tool called [Upgrade Helper](https://react-native-community.github.io/upgrade-helper/) to make the upgrade process simpler. It helps React Native users with brownfield apps or complex customizations to see what's changed between versions. Take a look at the [updated upgrading docs](/docs/upgrading) and try it out today for your upgrade path!

![Upgrade Helper cleanly and easily shows the changes needed to migrate to a different version of React Native](/assets/images/0.60-upgrade-helper-220ec6d7cb848ee06ae952c142c1cf2a.png)

A Note to Library Maintainers[​](#a-note-to-library-maintainers "Direct link to A Note to Library Maintainers")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes for AndroidX will almost certainly require updates to your library, so be sure to include support soon. If you're not able to upgrade yet, consider checking your library against the jetifier to confirm that users are able to patch your library at build time.

Review the [autolinking](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md) docs to update your configs and readme. Depending on how your library was previously integrated, you may also need to make some additional changes. Check the [dependencies](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/dependencies.md) guide from the CLI for information on how to define your dependency interface.

Thanks[​](#thanks "Direct link to Thanks")
------------------------------------------

While these are the highlights that we noted, there are many others to be excited about. To see all the updates, take a look at the [changelog](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-releases/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). As always, stay tuned for more news. Enjoy 0.60 in the meantime!

Code & Community Health[​](#code--community-health "Direct link to Code & Community Health")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the past six months, a total of 2800 commits were made to React Native by more than 550 contributors. 400 contributors from the community created more than [1,150 Pull Requests](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pulls?page=24&q=is%3Apr+closed%3A%3E2018-12-01&utf8=%E2%9C%93), of which [820 Pull Requests](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+closed%3A%3E2018-12-01+label%3A%22Merged%22+) were merged.

The average number of Pull Requests per day throughout the past six months has increased from three to about six, even though we split the website, CLI and many modules out of React Native via the Lean Core effort. The average amount of open pull requests is now below 25 and we usually reply with suggestions and reviews within hours or days.

### Meaningful Community Contributions[​](#meaningful-community-contributions "Direct link to Meaningful Community Contributions")

We’d like to highlight a number of recent contributions which we thought were awesome:

* **Accessibility:** React Native 0.60 will ship with many improvements to accessibility APIs both on Android and iOS. All of the new features are directly using APIs provided by the underlying platform so they’ll integrate with native assistance technologies both on Android and iOS. We’d like to thank [Marc Mulcahy](https://github.com/marcmulcahy), [Alan Kenyon](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/24746), [Estevão Lucas](https://github.com/elucaswork), [Sam Mathias Weggersen](https://github.com/sweggersen) and [Janic Duplessis](https://twitter.com/janicduplessis) for their contributions:
  + [Additional Accessibility Roles + States](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/24095) and a [new Accessibility States API](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/24608). Added a number of missing accessibility roles for various components and a new API for better web support in the future.
  + [AccessibilityInfo.announceForAccessibility](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/24746). Added support for Android, previously iOS-only.
  + [Extended Accessibility Actions Support](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/24695). Added callbacks to deal with accessibility around user-defined actions.
  + [Support for iOS Accessibility flags](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/23913) and [support for "reduce motion"](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/23839).
  + [Android keyboard accessibility improvements](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/24359). Added a `clickable` prop and an `onClick` callback for invoking actions via keyboard navigation *(note: this will soon be renamed to `focusable`).*
  + [Use CALayers to draw text](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/24387). Fixed an issue that made scaled-up text disappear on iOS.
* **New App Screen:** The community came up with a [design for the new app screen](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/122) that is implemented in 0.60. This screen is what most people see when they are first using React Native. It now links first time users to the documentation and the look fits with our upcoming website redesign 🌟. Huge thanks to [Orta](https://twitter.com/orta), [Adam Shurson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashurson/), [Glauber Castro](https://github.com/glauberfc), [Karan Singh](https://github.com/karanpratapsingh), [Eli Perkins](https://twitter.com/_eliperkins), [Lucas Bento](https://twitter.com/lbentosilva) and [Eric Lewis](https://twitter.com/ericlewis) for all their work and collaboration!
  + Check out the new app screen on the “*[React Native Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImlAqMZxveg)*“ video series.
* **TurboModule Types:** The new [TurboModules system](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/40) requires [types for all native modules](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/24875) to guarantee type safe operations in native. In just over two weeks, the community sent ~40 Pull Requests to complete this work for flow typed native modules. Aside from the people already mentioned above, we’d like to thank [Michał Chudziak](https://twitter.com/michalchudziak), [Michał Pierzchała](https://twitter.com/thymikee), [Wojtek Szafraniec](https://github.com/wojteg1337), and [Jean Regisser](https://github.com/jeanregisser) and everyone else who sent one or more Pull Requests.
* **Haste:** Since 2015 React Native used the [“haste” module system](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/commit/0629e3e2289ed54fac854472aec9a5f6c8318c98#diff-c42b758729cb89976b3a8fd51d1227fa) that allows importing modules just via a global id instead of a relative path which is convenient but not well supported by many tools. [James Ide](https://twitter.com/JI) proposed removing haste, similar to how React removed haste many years ago. He planned all the work through an [umbrella task](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/24316) and he sent 18 Pull Requests to make it happen! Check out [his Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/JI/status/1136369775083319296) to learn more.
* **Android Fragments:** [John Shelley](https://github.com/jpshelley)‘s proposal to make React Native work via [Android Fragments](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/12199) was merged and will be available in 0.61. [Read more about Android Fragments here](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments).

### Lean Core[​](#lean-core "Direct link to Lean Core")

The primary motivation of [Lean Core](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/6) has been to split modules out of React Native into separate repositories so they can receive better maintenance. In just a six months repositories like [WebView](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview), [NetInfo](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-netinfo), [AsyncStorage](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-async-storage), the [website](https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website) and the [CLI](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli) received more than 800 Pull Requests combined. Besides better maintenance, these projects can also be independently released more often than React Native itself.

We have also taken the opportunity to remove obsolete polyfills and legacy components from React Native itself. Polyfills were necessary in the past to support language features like [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) and [`Set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set) in older versions of JavaScriptCore (JSC). Now that React Native ships with a new version, these polyfills were removed.

This work is still in progress and many more things still need to be split out or removed both on the native and JavaScript side but there are early signs that we managed to reverse the trend of increasing the surface area and app size: When looking at the JavaScript bundle for example, about a year ago in version 0.54 the React Native JavaScript bundle size was 530kb and grew to 607kb (+77kb) by version 0.57 in just 6 months. Now we are seeing a bundle size reduction of 28kb down to 579kb on master, a delta of more than 100kb!

As we conclude the first iteration of the Lean Core effort, we will make an effort to be more intentional about new APIs added to React Native and we will continuously evaluate ways to make React Native smaller and faster, as well as finding ways to empower the community to take ownership of various components.

User Feedback[​](#user-feedback "Direct link to User Feedback")
---------------------------------------------------------------

Six months ago we asked the community “[What do you dislike about React Native?](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/64)” which gave a good overview of problems people are facing. We [replied to the post a few months ago](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/104) and it's time to summarize the progress that was made on top issues:

* **Upgrading:** The React Native community rallied around with multiple improvements to the upgrading experience: [autolinking](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md), a better upgrading command via [rn-diff-purge](https://github.com/react-native-community/rn-diff-purge), an upgrade helper website (coming soon). We’ll also make sure to communicate breaking changes and exciting new features by publishing blog posts for each major release. Many of these improvements will make future upgrades beyond the 0.60 release significantly easier.
* **Support / Uncertainty:** Many people were frustrated with the lack of activity on Pull Requests and general uncertainty about Facebook's investment in React Native. As we've shown above, we can confidently say that we are ready for many more Pull Requests and we are eagerly looking forward to your proposals and contributions!
* **Performance:** React Native 0.59 shipped with a new and much faster version of JavaScriptCore (JSC). Separately, we have been working on making it easier to enable [inline-requires](/docs/performance#ram-bundles-inline-requires) by default and we have more exciting updates for you in the next couple of months.
* **Documentation:** We recently started an effort to [overhaul and rewrite all of React Native's documentation](https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website/issues/929). If you are looking to contribute, we’d love to get your help!
* **Warnings in Xcode:** We [got rid of all the existing warnings](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/22609) and are making an effort not to introduce new warnings.
* **Hot Reloading:** The React team is building a [new hot reloading system](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1126948870137753605) that will soon be integrated into React Native.

Unfortunately we weren’t able to improve everything just yet:

* **Debugging:** We fixed many inconvenient bugs and issues people that we have been running into every day, but unfortunately we haven't made as much progress on this as we would like. We recognize that debugging with React Native isn't great and we'll prioritize improving this in the future.
* **Metro symlinks:** Unfortunately we haven't been able to implement a simple and straightforward solution for this yet. However, React Native users [shared various workarounds](https://github.com/facebook/metro/issues/1) that may work for you.

Given the large amount of changes in the past six months, we'd like to ask you the same question again. If you are using the latest version of React Native and you have things you'd like to give feedback on, please comment on our new edition of [“What do you dislike about React Native?”](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/134)

Continuous Integration[​](#continuous-integration "Direct link to Continuous Integration")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Facebook merges all Pull Requests and internal changes directly into Facebook’s repository first and then syncs all commits back to GitHub. Facebook’s infrastructure is different from common continuous integration services and not all open source tests were run inside of Facebook. This means that commits that sync out to GitHub frequently break tests in open source which take a lot of time to fix.

[Héctor Ramos](https://twitter.com/hectorramos) from the React Native team spent the past two months improving React Native's continuous integration systems both at Facebook and on GitHub. Most of the open source tests are now run before changes are committed to React Native at Facebook which will keep CI stable on GitHub when commits are being synchronized.

Next[​](#next "Direct link to Next")
------------------------------------

Make sure to check out our talks about the future of React Native! In the next couple of months, members of the React Native team at Facebook will speak at [Chain React](https://infinite.red/ChainReactConf) and at [React Native EU](https://react-native.eu/). Also, watch out for our next release, 0.60, which is right around the corner. *It's going to be exciting* ✨

This week, [Eli White](https://twitter.com/Eli_White) gave a talk at [F8 2019](https://developers.facebook.com/videos/2019/mobile-innovation-with-react-native-componentkit-and-litho/) about React Native in Facebook's Android and iOS applications. We are excited to share what we've been up to for the past two years and what we're doing next.

Check out the video on [Facebook's developer website](https://developers.facebook.com/videos/2019/mobile-innovation-with-react-native-componentkit-and-litho/):

[![F8 Talk about React Native](/blog/assets/eli-at-f8.png)](https://developers.facebook.com/videos/2019/mobile-innovation-with-react-native-componentkit-and-litho/)

#### Highlights from the talk:[​](#highlights-from-the-talk "Direct link to Highlights from the talk:")

* We spent 2017 and 2018 focused on React Native's largest product, Facebook's Marketplace. We collaborated with the Marketplace team to improve quality and add delight to the product. At this point, Marketplace is one of the highest quality products in the Facebook app both on Android and iOS.
* Marketplace's performance was a big challenge as well, especially on mid-end Android devices. We cut startup time by more than 50% over the last year with more improvements on the way! The biggest improvements are being built into React Native and will be coming to the community later this year.
* We have the confidence that we can build the high quality and performant apps that Facebook needs with React Native. This confidence has let us invest in bigger bets, like [rethinking the core of React Native](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcqRXTriUVI&app=desktop).
* Microsoft supports and uses React Native for Windows, enabling people to use their expertise and codebase to render to Microsofts's Universal Windows Platform. Check out Microsoft Build next week to [hear them talk about that more](https://mybuild.techcommunity.microsoft.com/sessions/77321).

### React Radio Podcast about Open Source[​](#react-radio-podcast-about-open-source "Direct link to React Radio Podcast about Open Source")

Eli's talk concludes by talking about our recent open source work. We gave [an update on our progress in March](/blog/2019/03/01/react-native-open-source-update) and recently [Nader Dabit](https://twitter.com/dabit3) and [Gant Laborde](https://twitter.com/GantLaborde) invited Christoph for a chat on their podcast, [React Native Radio](https://devchat.tv/react-native-radio/react-native-open-source-the-react-native-community-feat-christoph-nakazawa/), to chat about React Native in open source.

#### Highlights from the podcast:[​](#highlights-from-the-podcast "Direct link to Highlights from the podcast:")

* We talked about how the React Native team at Facebook thinks about open source and how we are building a sustainable community that scales for a project of React Native's [size](https://octoverse.github.com/projects#repositories).
* We are on track to remove multiple modules as part of the [Lean Core](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/23313) effort. Many modules like WebView and the React Native CLI have received more than 100 Pull Requests since they were extracted.
* Next, we'll be focusing on overhauling the React Native website and documentation. Stay tuned!

[Releasing React Native 0.59](/blog/2019/03/12/releasing-react-native-059)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

March 12, 2019 · 6 min read

[Ryan Turner](https://twitter.com/turnrye)

Core Maintainer & React Native Developer

Welcome to the 0.59 release of React Native! This is another big release with 644 commits by 88 contributors. Contributions also come in other forms, so *thank you* for maintaining issues, fostering communities, and teaching people about React Native. This month brings a number of highly anticipated changes, and we hope you enjoy them.

🎣 Hooks are here[​](#-hooks-are-here "Direct link to 🎣 Hooks are here")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

React Hooks are part of this release, which let you reuse stateful logic across components. There is a lot of buzz about hooks, but if you haven't heard, take a look at some of the wonderful resources below:

> * [Introducing Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) explains why we’re adding Hooks to React.
> * [Hooks at a Glance](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html) is a fast-paced overview of the built-in Hooks.
> * [Building Your Own Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html) demonstrates code reuse with custom Hooks.
> * [Making Sense of React Hooks](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/making-sense-of-react-hooks-fdbde8803889) explores the new possibilities unlocked by Hooks.
> * [useHooks.com](https://usehooks.com/) showcases community-maintained Hooks recipes and demos.

Be sure to give this a try in your apps. We hope that you find the reuse as exciting as we do.

📱 Updated JSC means performance gains and 64-bit support on Android[​](#-updated-jsc-means-performance-gains-and-64-bit-support-on-android "Direct link to 📱 Updated JSC means performance gains and 64-bit support on Android")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

React Native uses JSC ([JavaScriptCore](https://webkit.org/)) to power your application. JSC on Android was a few years old, which meant that a lot of modern JavaScript features weren't supported. Even worse, it performed poorly compared iOS's modern JSC. With this release, that all changes.

Thanks to some awesome work by [@DanielZlotin](https://github.com/danielzlotin), [@dulmandakh](https://github.com/dulmandakh), [@gengjiawen](https://github.com/gengjiawen), [@kmagiera](https://github.com/kmagiera), and [@kudo](https://github.com/kudo) JSC has caught up with the past few years. This brings with it 64-bit support, modern JavaScript support, and [big performance improvements](https://github.com/react-native-community/jsc-android-buildscripts/tree/master/measure). Kudos for also making this a maintainable process now so that we can take advantage of future WebKit improvements without so much legwork, and thank you Software Mansion and Expo for making this work possible.

💨 Faster app launches with inline requires[​](#-faster-app-launches-with-inline-requires "Direct link to 💨 Faster app launches with inline requires")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We want to help people have performant React Native apps by default and are working to bring Facebook's optimizations to the community. Applications load resources as needed rather than slowing down launch. This feature is called "inline requires", as it lets Metro identify components to be lazy loaded. Apps with a deep and varied component architecture will see the most improvement.

![source of the metro.config.js file in the 0.59 template, demonstrating where to enable inlineRequires](/assets/images/inline-requires-3cb1be96938288642a666bdf3dca62b5.png)

We need the community to let us know how it works before we turn it on by default. When you upgrade to 0.59, there will be a new `metro.config.js` file; flip the options to true and give us [your feedback](https://twitter.com/hashtag/inline-requires)! Read more about inline requires [in the performance docs](/docs/performance#inline-requires) to benchmark your app.

🚅 Lean core is underway[​](#-lean-core-is-underway "Direct link to 🚅 Lean core is underway")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

React Native is a large and complex project with a complicated repository. This makes the codebase less approachable to contributors, difficult to test, and bloated as a dev dependency. [Lean Core](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/6) is our effort to address these issues by migrating code to separate libraries for better management. The past few releases have seen the first steps of this, but [let's get serious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMLKb4or8yg).

You may notice that additional components are now officially deprecated. This is great news, as there are now owners for these features actively maintaining them. Heed the warning messages and migrate to the new libraries for these features, because they will be removed in a future release. Below is a table indicating the component, its status, and where you may migrate your use to.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Over the coming months, there will be many more components following this path to a leaner core. We're looking for help with this — head over to the [lean core umbrella](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/23313) to pitch in.

👩🏽‍💻 CLI improvements[​](#-cli-improvements "Direct link to 👩🏽‍💻 CLI improvements")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

React Native's command line tools are developer's entry point to the ecosystem, but they had long-standing issues and lacked official support. The CLI tools have been moved to a [new repository](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-cli), and a [dedicated group of maintainers](https://blog.callstack.io/the-react-native-cli-has-a-new-home-79b63838f0e6) have already made some exciting improvements.

Logs are formatted much better now. Commands now run nearly instantly — you'll immediately notice a difference:

🚀 Upgrading to 0.59[​](#-upgrading-to-059 "Direct link to 🚀 Upgrading to 0.59")
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We heard your feedback regarding the [React Native upgrade process](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/68) and we are taking steps to improve the experience in [future releases](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/64#issuecomment-444775432). To upgrade to 0.59, we recommend using [`rn-diff-purge`](https://github.com/react-native-community/rn-diff-purge) to determine what has changed between your current React Native version and 0.59, then applying those changes manually. Once you've upgraded your project to 0.59, you will be able to use the newly improved `react-native upgrade` command (based on `rn-diff-purge`!) to upgrade to 0.60 and beyond as newer releases become available.

🔨 Breaking Changes[​](#-breaking-changes "Direct link to 🔨 Breaking Changes")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Android support in 0.59 has been cleaned up following Google's latest recommendations, which may result in potential breakage of existing apps. This issue might present as a runtime crash and a message, "You need to use a Theme.AppCompat theme (or descendant) with this activity". We recommend updating your project's `AndroidManifest.xml` file, making sure that the `android:theme` value is an `AppCompat` theme (such as `@style/Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar`).

The `react-native-git-upgrade` command has been removed in 0.59, in favor of the newly improved `react-native upgrade` command.

🤗 Thanks[​](#-thanks "Direct link to 🤗 Thanks")
-----------------------------------------------

Lots of new contributors helped with [enabling generation of native code from flow types](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/22990) and [resolving Xcode warnings](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/22609) - these are a great way to learn how React Native works and contributing to the greater good. Thank you! Look out for similar issues in the future.

While these are the highlights that we noted, there are many others to be excited about. To see all of the updates, take a look at the [changelog](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-releases/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). 0.59 is a huge release – we can't wait for you to try it out.

We have even more improvements coming throughout the rest of the year. Stay tuned!

[React Native Open Source Update March 2019](/blog/2019/03/01/react-native-open-source-update)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

March 1, 2019 · 5 min read

![Christoph Nakazawa](https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/13352?s=460&v=4)

Christoph Nakazawa

Former Engineer @ Facebook

We announced our [React Native Open Source roadmap](/blog/2018/11/01/oss-roadmap) in Q4 2018 after deciding to invest more in the React Native open source community.

For our first milestone, we focused on identifying and improving the most visible aspects of our community. Our goals were to reduce outstanding pull requests, reduce the project's surface area, identify leading user problems, and establish guidelines for community management.

In the past two months, we made more progress than we expected. Read on for more details:

### Pull Requests[​](#pull-requests "Direct link to Pull Requests")

In order to build a healthy community, we must respond quickly to code contributions. In past years, we de-prioritized reviewing community contributions and accumulated 280 pull requests (December 2018). In the first milestone, we reduced the number of open pull requests to ~65. Simultaneously, the average number of pull requests opened per day increased from 3.5 to 7 which means we have handled about [600 pull requests](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pulls?page=24&q=is%3Apr+closed%3A%3E2018-12-01&utf8=%E2%9C%93) in the last three months.

We merged [almost two-thirds](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+closed%3A%3E2018-12-01+label%3A%22Merged%22+) and closed one-third of the pull requests. They were closed without being merged if they are obsolete or low quality, or if they unnecessarily increase the project's surface area. Most of the merged pull requests fixed bugs, improved cross-platform parity, or introduced new features. Notable contributions include improving type safety and the ongoing work to support AndroidX.

At Facebook, we run React Native from master, so we test all changes first before they make it into a React Native Release. Out of all the merged pull requests, only six caused issues: four only affected internal development and two were caught in the release candidate state.

One of the more visible community contributions was [the updated “RedBox” screen](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/22242). It's a good example of how the community is making the developer experience friendlier.

### Lean Core[​](#lean-core "Direct link to Lean Core")

React Native currently has a very wide surface area with many unmaintained abstractions that we do not use a lot at Facebook. We are working on reducing the surface area in order to make React Native smaller and allow the community to take better care of abstractions that are mostly unused at Facebook.

In the first milestone, [we asked the community for help on the Lean Core project](https://twitter.com/reactnative/status/1093171521114247171). The response was overwhelming and we could barely keep up with all the progress. [Check out all the work completed in less than a month](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/23313)!

What we are most excited about is that maintainers have jumped in fixing long standing issues, adding tests, and supporting long requested features. These modules are getting more support than they ever did within React Native, showing that this is a great step for the community. Examples of such projects are [WebView](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview) that has [received many pull requests](https://twitter.com/titozzz/status/1101283928026034176) since their extraction and the CLI that is now [maintained by members of the community](https://blog.callstack.io/the-react-native-cli-has-a-new-home-79b63838f0e6) and received much needed improvements and fixes.

### Leading User Problems[​](#leading-user-problems "Direct link to Leading User Problems")

In December, we asked the community what they [disliked about React Native](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/64). We aggregated the responses and [replied to each and every problem](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/104). Fortunately, many of the issues that our community faces are also problems at Facebook. In our next milestone, we plan to address some of the main problems.

One of the highest voted problems was the developer experience of upgrading to newer versions of React Native. Unfortunately, this is not something that we experience ourselves because we run React Native from master. Thankfully, members from the community already stepped up to address this problem:

* [Michał Pierzchała](https://github.com/thymikee) from Callstack [improved react-native upgrade](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-cli/pull/176/files) by using [rn-diff-purge](https://github.com/react-native-community/rn-diff-purge) under the hood. We also updated the website to remove outdated upgrade instructions.
* [We plan on recommending CocoaPods by default for iOS projects](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/23563) which will reduce churn in project files when upgrading React Native. This will make it easier for people to install and link third-party modules which is even more important in the context of Lean Core as we expect projects to link more modules by default.

### 0.59 Release[​](#059-release "Direct link to 0.59 Release")

Without the help of the React Native community, especially [Mike Grabowski](https://github.com/grabbou) and [Lorenzo Sciandra](https://github.com/kelset), we would not be able to ship releases. We want to improve the release management process and plan to be more involved from now on:

* We will work with community members to create a blog post for each major release.
* We will show breaking changes directly in the CLI when people upgrade to new versions.
* We will reduce the time it takes to make a release. We are exploring ways to increase automated testing and also creating an improved manual test plan.

Many of these plans will be incorporated in the upcoming [React Native 0.59 release](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases/tag/v0.59.0-rc.3). 0.59 will ship with React Hooks, a new 64-bit version of JavaScriptCore for Android, and many performance and functionality improvements. It is currently published as a release candidate and is expected to be stable within the next two weeks.

### Next Steps[​](#next-steps "Direct link to Next Steps")

For the next two months, we will continue managing pull requests [to stay on track](https://k03lwm00zo.codesandbox.io/) while also starting to reduce the number of outstanding GitHub issues. We will continue reducing the surface area of React Native through the Lean Core project. We plan to address 5 of the top community problems. As we finalize the community guidelines, we will turn attention to our website and documentation.

We are very excited to host over ten contributors from our community at Facebook London in March to help drive several of these efforts. We are glad that you are using React Native and hope that you'll see and feel the improvements we are working on in 2019. We'll be back with another update in a few months and *will be merging your pull requests in the meantime!* ⚛️✌️
