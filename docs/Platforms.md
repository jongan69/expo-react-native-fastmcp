React Native

Create native apps for Android, iOS, and more using React
=========================================================

### React Native brings the best parts of developing with React to native development. It's a best-in-class JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

index.js

```
function HomeScreen() {   
  return (   
    <View>   
      <Text> Hello World 👋 🌍!</Text>  
    </View>   
  );   
}
```

**Written in JavaScript, rendered with native code.** React primitives render to native platform UI, meaning your app uses the same native platform APIs other apps do.
